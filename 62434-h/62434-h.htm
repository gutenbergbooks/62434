<p>“Since the times of Eliot Warburton and Kinglake many
writers have celebrated the delights of travel in the desert.
None, I think, has realised the fascination of the desert more
fully than Mr Weigall.”&mdash;<cite>Westminster Gazette.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Ward</span>, F.S.A. (author of ‘Pyramids and Progress,’
&amp;c.), writes: “... The very best book of travel ... I
have seen for years; so interesting that it can be read with
pleasure by people who know not Egypt, and so unpretendingly
scientific ... that to one who is an expert Egyptologist it is a
treasure-trove. The language is so clear, the descriptive portions
so graphic, and yet the style so simple, that the work is, in its
way, a masterpiece. Then the clear type, the handy size, and the
exquisite photographs make the book a rare possession.”</p></div>

<p>Mr Weigall has performed a remarkable literary feat. He has
truly made dry bones live, and has presented his researches in
Egyptology in a manner so fascinating as to arouse the enthusiasm
of the patrons of the circulating libraries. Of this volume it
is enough to say that it is worthy of the author of ‘The Life and
Times of Akhnaton.’</p></div>

<hr class="r10" />

<h2 class="no-brk fs100"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p class="noindent">The reign of Akhnaton, for seventeen years
Pharaoh of Egypt (from <span class="fs70">B.C.</span> 1375 to 1358),
stands out as the most interesting epoch in
the long sequence of Egyptian history. We
have watched the endless line of dim Pharaohs
go by, each lit momentarily by the pale lamp of
our present knowledge, and most of them have
left little impression upon the mind. They are
so misty and far off, they have been dead and
gone for such thousands of years, that they have
almost entirely lost their individuality. We call
out some royal name, and in response a vague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
figure passes into view, stiffly moves its arms,
and passes again into the darkness. With one
there comes the muffled noise of battle; with
another there is singing and the sound of music;
with yet another the wailing of the oppressed
drifts by. But at the name Akhnaton there
emerges from the darkness a figure more clear
than that of any other Pharaoh, and with it
there comes the singing of birds, the laughter of
children, and the scent of many flowers. For
once we may look right into the mind of a king
of Egypt and may see something of its workings;
and all that is there observed is worthy
of admiration. Akhnaton has been called “the
first individual in human history”;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but if he is
thus the first historical figure whose personality
is known to us, he is also the first of all human
founders of religious doctrines. Akhnaton may
be ranked in degree of time, and perhaps also in
degree of genius, as the world’s first idealist;
and, since in all ancient Oriental research there
never has been, and probably never will be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
brought before us a subject of such intellectual
interest as this Pharaoh’s religious revolution,
which marks the first point in the study of
advanced human thought, a careful consideration
of this short reign deserves to be made.</p>

<p>The following pages do not pretend to do more
than acquaint the reader with the subject, at a
time when, owing to the recent discovery of the
Pharaoh’s bones, some interest may have been
aroused in his career. A series of volumes have
lately been issued by the Egypt Exploration
Fund,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in which accurate copies are to be found
of the reliefs, paintings, and inscriptions upon the
walls of the tombs of some of Akhnaton’s disciples
and followers. In the year 1893 Professor Flinders
Petrie excavated the site of the city which the
Pharaoh founded, and published the results of his
work in a volume entitled ‘Tell el Amarna.’<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Recently Professor J. H. Breasted has devoted
some space to a masterly study of this period
in his ‘History of Egypt’ and ‘Ancient Records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of Egypt.’<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> From these publications the reader
will be able to refer himself to the remaining
literature dealing with the subject; but he
should bear in mind that the discovery<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of the
bones of Akhnaton himself, which have shown
us how old he was when he died&mdash;namely,
about twenty-eight years of age,&mdash;have modified
many of the deductions there made. Those who
have travelled in Egypt will probably have
visited the site of Akhnaton’s city, near the
modern village of El Amarna; and in the
museums of Cairo, London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna,
Leiden, and elsewhere, they will perhaps have
seen some of the relics of his age.</p>

<p>During the last few years an extraordinary
series of discoveries has been made in the Valley
of the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes. In 1903
the tomb of Thothmes IV., the paternal grandfather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of Akhnaton, was discovered; in 1905 the
tomb of Yuaa and Tuau, the maternal grandparents
of Akhnaton, was found; in 1907 Akhnaton’s
body was discovered in the tomb of his
mother, Queen Tiy; and in 1908 the tomb of the
Pharaoh Horemheb, one of the immediate successors
of Akhnaton, was brought to light. At
all but the first of these discoveries the present
writer had the pleasure of assisting; and a particular
interest in the period was thus engendered,
of which the following sketch, prepared during
an Upper Egyptian summer, is an outcome. It
must be understood, however, that a volume
written at such times as the exigencies of
official work allowed&mdash;partly in the shade of
the rocks beside the Nile, partly at railway-stations
or in the train, partly amidst the ruins
of ancient temples, and partly in the darkened
rooms of official quarters&mdash;cannot claim the
value of a treatise prepared in an English study
where books of reference are always at hand. It
is hoped, however, that no errors have been made
in the statement of the facts; and the deductions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
drawn therefrom are frankly open to the reader’s
criticism. There will certainly be no two opinions
as to the acknowledgment of the originality, the
power, and the idealism of the Pharaoh whose
life is now to be outlined.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

THE PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS
OF AKHNATON.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<h3>1. THE ANCESTORS OF AKHNATON.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The Eighteenth Dynasty of Egyptian kings took
possession of the throne of the Pharaohs in
the year 1580 <span class="fs70">B.C.</span>, over thirteen hundred
years after the buildings of the great pyramids,
and some two thousand years after the beginning
of dynastic history in the Nile Valley. The
founder of the dynasty was the Pharaoh
Aahmes I. He drove out the Asiatics who
had overrun the country during the previous
century, and pursued them into the heart of
Syria. His successor, Amonhotep I., penetrated
as far as the territory between the
Orontes and the Euphrates; and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
king, Thothmes I., was able to set his boundary-stone
at the northern limits of Syria, and
thus could call himself the ruler of the entire
east end of the Mediterranean, the emperor
of all the countries from Asia Minor to the
Sudan. Thothmes II., the succeeding Pharaoh,
was occupied with wars in his southern dominions;
but his successor, the famous Queen
Hatshepsut, was able to devote the years
of her reign to the arts of peace.</p>

<p>She was followed by the great warrior
Thothmes III., who conducted campaign after
campaign in Syria, and raised the prestige
of Egypt to a point never attained before
or after that time. Every year he returned
to Thebes, his capital, laden with the spoils
of Asia. From the capture of the city of
Megiddo alone he carried away 924 splendid
chariots, 2238 horses, 2400 head of various
kinds of cattle, 200 shining suits of armour,
including those of two kings, quantities of
gold and silver, the royal sceptre, the gorgeous
tent of one of the kings, and many minor
articles. Booty of like value was brought in
from other shattered kingdoms, and the Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
treasuries were full to overflowing. The temples
of the gods also received their share of the
riches, and their altars groaned under the
weight of the offerings. Cyprus, Crete, and
perhaps the islands of the Ægean, sent their
yearly tribute to Thebes, whose streets, for
the first time in their history, were thronged
with foreigners. Here were to be seen the
long-robed Asiatics bearing vases fresh from
the hands of Tyrian craftsmen; here were
chariots mounted with gold and electrum
drawn by prancing Syrian horses; here were
Phœnician merchants with their precious wares
stripped from the kingdoms of the sea; here
were negroes bearing their barbaric treasures
to the palace. The Egyptian soldiers held
their heads high as they walked through these
streets, for they were feared by all the world.
The talk was everywhere of conquest, and the
tales of adventure now related remained current
in Egypt for many a century. War-songs were
composed, and hymns of battle were inscribed
upon the temple walls. The spirit of the age
will be seen in the following lines, in which
the god Amon addresses Thothmes III.:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“I have come, giving thee to smite the princes of Zahi,</p>
<p class="verse0">I have hurled them beneath thy feet among their highlands....</p>
<p class="verse0">Thou hast trampled those who are in the districts of Punt,</p>
<p class="verse0">I have made them see thy majesty as a circling star....</p>
<p class="verse0">Crete and Cyprus are in terror....</p>
<p class="verse0">Those who are in the midst of the great sea hear thy roarings;</p>
<p class="verse0">I have made them see thy majesty as an avenger,</p>
<p class="verse0">Rising upon the back of his slain victim....</p>
<p class="verse0">I have made them see thy majesty as a fierce-eyed lion,</p>
<p class="verse0">While thou makest them corpses in their valleys....”</p>
</div></div>

<p>It was a fierce and a splendid age&mdash;the zenith
of Egypt’s great history. The next king, Amonhotep
II., carried on the conquests with a degree
of ferocity not previously apparent. He himself
was a man of great physical strength, who could
draw a bow which none of his soldiers could
use. He led his armies into his restless Asiatic
dominions, and having captured seven rebellious
Syrian kings, he hung them head downwards
from the prow of his galley as he approached
Thebes, and later sacrificed six of them to Amon
with his own hand. The seventh he carried up
to a distant city of the Sudan, and there hung
him upon the gateway as a warning to all
rebels. Dying in the year 1420 <span class="fs70">B.C.</span>, he left the
throne to his son, Thothmes IV., the grandfather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of Akhnaton, who at his accession was about
eighteen years of age.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>


<h3>2. THE GODS OF EGYPT.</h3>

<p>With the reign of Thothmes IV. we reach a
period of history in which the beginnings are to
be observed of certain religious movements, which
become more apparent in the time of his son
Amonhotep III. and his grandson Akhnaton.
We must look, therefore, more closely at the
events of this reign, and must especially observe
their religious aspect. For this reason, and also
in order that the reader may the more readily
appreciate, by contrast, the pure teachings of
the Pharaoh whose life forms the subject of the
following pages, it will be necessary to glance at
the nature of the religions which now held sway.
Egypt had at this time existed as a civilised
nation for over two thousand years, during the
whole of which period these religious beliefs had
been developing; and now they were so engrained
in the hearts of the people that changes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
however slight, assumed revolutionary proportions,
requiring a master-mind for their initiation, and
a hand of iron for their carrying into execution.
At the time of which we now write, this mind
and this hand had not yet come into existence,
and the old gods of Egypt were at the zenith
of their power.</p>

<p>Of these gods Amon, the presiding deity of
Thebes, was the most powerful. He had been
originally the tribal god of the Thebans, but
when that city had become the capital of Egypt,
he had risen to be the state god of the country.
The sun-god Ra, or Ra-Horakhti, originally the
deity of Heliopolis, a city not far from the
modern Cairo, had been the state god in earlier
times, and the priests of Amon contrived to
identify the two deities under the name “Amon-Ra,
King of the Gods.” Amon had several
forms. He was usually regarded as a man of
shining countenance, upon whose head two tall
feathers arose from a golden cap. Sometimes,
however, he assumed the form of a heavy-horned
ram. Sometimes, again, he adopted the appearance
of a brother god, named Min, who was later
identified with the Greek Pan; and it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
mentioned in passing that the goat-form of the
Greek deity may have been derived from this
Min-Amon of the Thebans. On occasions Amon
would take upon himself the likeness of the
reigning Pharaoh, choosing a moment when the
monarch was away or was asleep, and in this
manner he would obtain admittance to the
queen’s bed-chamber. Amonhotep III. himself
was said to be the son of a union of this
nature, though at the same time he did not
deny that his earthly father was Thothmes IV.
Amon delighted in battle, and gave willing assistance
to the Pharaohs as they clubbed the
heads of their enemies or cut their throats. It
is possible that, like other of the Egyptian gods,
he was but a deified chieftain of the prehistoric
period whose love of battle had never been
forgotten.</p>

<p>The goddess Mut, “the Mother,” was the
consort of Amon, who would sometimes come
to earth to nurse the king’s son at her breast.
By Amon she had a son, Khonsu, who formed
the third member of the Theban trinity. He
was the god of the Moon, and was very fair
to look upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the Theban deities, whose influence
upon the court was necessarily great. The Heliopolitan
worship of the sun had also a very considerable
degree of power at the palace. The
god Ra was believed to have reigned as Pharaoh
upon earth in the dim ages of the past, and
it was thought that the successive sovereigns
of Egypt were his direct descendants, though
this tradition actually did not date from a period
earlier than the Fifth Dynasty. “Son of the
Sun” was one of the proudest titles of the
Pharaohs, and the personal name of each successive
monarch was held by him in the official
titulary as the representative of Ra. While on
earth Ra had had the misfortune to be bitten
by a snake, and had been cured by the goddess
Isis, who had demanded in return the revealing
of the god’s magical name. This was at last
told her; but for fear that the secret would
come to the ears of his subjects, Ra decided to
bring about a general massacre of mankind. The
slaughter was carried out by the goddess Hathor
in her form of Sekhmet, a fierce lion-headed
woman, who delighted to wade in streams of
blood; but when only the half of mankind had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
been slain, Ra repented, and brought the massacre
to an end by causing the goddess to become
drunk, by means of a gruesome potion of
blood and wine. Weary, however, with the cares
of state, he decided to retire into the heavens,
and there, as the sun, he daily sailed in his boat
from horizon to horizon. At dawn he was called
Khepera, and had the form of a beetle; at noon
he was Ra; and at sunset he took the name
of Atum, a word derived from the Syrian Adon,
“Lord,” better known to us in its Greek translation
“Adonis.” As the rising and the setting
sun&mdash;that is to say, the sun near the horizon&mdash;he
was called Ra-Horakhti, a name which the
reader must bear in mind.</p>

<p>The goddess Isis, mentioned in the above
tradition, was the consort of Osiris, originally
a Lower Egyptian deity. Like Ra, this god
had also reigned upon earth, but had been
murdered by his brother Set, his death being
ultimately revenged by his son Horus, the
hawk. Thus Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed a
trinity, which at this time was mainly worshipped
at Abydos, a city of Upper Egypt, where
it was thought that Osiris had been buried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Having thus ceased to live upon earth, Osiris
became the great King of the Underworld, and
all persons prayed to him for their future welfare
after death.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Horus, the hawk, was the tribal
god of more than one city. At Edfu he was
worshipped as the conqueror of Set; and in this
manifestation he was the husband of Hathor,
the lady of Dendereh, a city some considerable
distance from Edfu. At Ombos, however, Set
was worshipped, and in the local religion there
was no trace of aught but the most friendly
relations between Set and Horus. The goddess
Hathor, at the same time, had become patron
of the Western Hills, and in one of her earthly
forms&mdash;namely, that of a cow&mdash;she is often seen
emerging from her cavern in the cliffs.</p>

<p>At Memphis the tribal god was the little
dwarf Ptah, the European Vulcan, the blacksmith,
the artificer, and the potter of the gods.
In this city also, as in many other districts of
Egypt, there was a sacred bull, here called Apis,
who was worshipped with divine honours and
was regarded as an aspect of Ptah. At Elephantine
a ram-headed deity named Khnum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was adored, and there was a sacred ram kept
in his temple for ceremonial purposes. As
Khnum had some connection with the First
Cataract of the Nile, which is situated near
Elephantine, he was regarded as of some importance
throughout Egypt. Moreover, he was
supposed by some to have used the mud at the
bottom of the Nile to form the first human
being, and thus he found a place in the mythology
of several districts.</p>

<p>A vulture, named Nekheb, was the tribal
deity of the trading city of Eileithiaspolis; a
ferocious crocodile, Sebek, was the god of a
second city of the name of Ombos; an ibis,
Thoth, was that of Hermopolis; a cat, Bast,
that of Bubastis; and so on&mdash;almost every city
having its tribal god. Besides these there were
other more abstract deities: Nut, the heavens,
who, in the form of a woman, spread herself
across the sky; Seb, the earth; Shu, the vastness
of space; and so forth. The old gods of
Egypt were indeed a multitude. Here were
those who had marched into the country at
the head of conquering tribes; here were
ancient heroes and Chieftains individually deified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
or often identified with the god whom
their tribe had served; here were the elements
personified; here the orbs of heaven which
man could see above him. As intercourse
between city and city became more general,
one set of beliefs had been brought into line
with another, and myths had developed to
explain the discrepancies. Thus in the time
of Thothmes IV. the heavens were crowded
with gods; but standing above them all, the
reader will do well to familiarise himself with
the figure of Amon-Ra, the god of Thebes,
and with Ra-Horakhti, the god of Heliopolis.
In the following pages the lesser denizens of
the Egyptian Olympus play no great part, save
as a routed army hurled back into the ignorant
darkness from which they came.</p>


<h3>3. THE DEMIGODS AND SPIRITS&mdash;THE
PRIESTHOODS.</h3>

<p>The sacred bulls and rams mentioned above
were relics of an ancient animal-worship, the
origin of which is lost in the obscurity of prehistory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The Egyptians paid homage to a variety
of animals, and almost every city or district
possessed its particular species to which special
protection was extended. At Hermopolis and
in other parts of Egypt the baboon was sacred,
as well as the ibis, which typified the god Thoth.
Cats were sacred both at Bubastis, where the cat-goddess,
Bast, resided, and in various other districts.
Crocodiles were very generally held in
reverence, and several river fish were thus
treated. The snake was much feared and
reverenced; and, as a pertinent example of this
superstition, it may be mentioned that Amonhotep III.,
the father of Akhnaton, placed a
figure of the agathodemon serpent in a temple
at Benha. The cobra was reverenced as the
symbol of Uazet, the goddess of the Delta, and,
first used as a royal emblem by the archaic
kings of that country, it became the main
emblem of sovereignty in Pharaonic times. It
is unnecessary here to look more closely at this
aspect of Egyptian religion; and but a word
need be said of the thousand demons and spirits
which, together with the gods and the sacred
animals, crowded the regions of the unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Many were the names which the magician might
call upon in the hour of his need, and many
were the awful forms which the soul of a man
who had died was liable to meet. Osiris, the
great god of the dead, was served by four such
genii, and under his authority there sat no less
than forty-two terrible demons whose business
it was to judge the quavering soul. The
numerous gates of the underworld were guarded
by monsters whose names alone would strike
terror into the heart, and the unfortunate soul
had to repeat endless and peculiarly tedious
formulæ before admittance was granted.</p>

<p>To minister to these hosts of heaven there
had of necessity to be vast numbers of priests.
At Thebes the priesthood of Amon formed an
organisation of such power and wealth that the
actions of the Pharaoh had largely come to be
controlled by it. The High Priest of Amon-Ra
was one of the most important personages in
the land, and his immediate subordinates, the
Second, Third, and Fourth Priests, as they were
called, were usually nobles of the highest rank.
The High Priest of Amon was at this period
often Grand Vizir also, and thus combined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
highest civil appointment with the highest
sacerdotal office. The priesthood of Ra at
Heliopolis, although of far less power than that
of Amon, was also a body of great importance.
The High Priest was known as “the Great
One of Visions,” and he was probably less of a
politician and more of a priest than his Theban
colleague. The High Priest of Ptah at Memphis
was called “the Great Master Artificer,” Ptah
being the Vulcan of Egypt. He, however, and
the many other high priests of the various gods,
did not rank with the two great leaders of the
Amon and the Ra priesthoods.</p>


<h3>4. THOTHMES IV. AND MUTEMUA.</h3>

<p>When Thothmes IV. ascended the throne he
was confronted by a very serious political problem.
The Heliopolitan priesthood at this time
was chafing against the power of Amon, and
was striving to restore the somewhat fallen
prestige of its own god Ra, who in the far
past had been the supreme deity of Egypt, but
had now to play an annoying second to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Theban god. Thothmes IV., as we shall
presently be told by Akhnaton himself,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> did
not altogether approve of the political character
of the Amon priesthood, and it may have been
due to this dissatisfaction that he undertook
the repairing of the great Sphinx at Gizeh,
which was in the care of the priests of Heliopolis.
The sphinx was thought to represent a
combination of the Heliopolitan gods Horakhti,
Khepera, Ra, and Atum, who have been
mentioned above; and, according to a later
tradition, Thothmes IV. had obtained the throne
over the heads of his elder brothers through
the mediation of the Sphinx&mdash;that is to say,
through that of the Heliopolitan priests. By
them he was called “Son of Atum and Protector
of Horakhte, ... who purifies Heliopolis and
satisfies Ra,”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and it seems that they looked
to him to restore to them their lost power. The
Pharaoh, however, was a physical weakling, whose
small amount of energy was entirely expended
upon his army, which he greatly loved, and
which he led into Syria and into the Sudan.
His brief reign of somewhat over eight years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from 1420 to 1411 <span class="fs70">B.C.</span>, marks but the indecisive
beginnings of the struggle between Amon and
Ra, which culminated in the early years of the
reign of his grandson Akhnaton.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_022_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Thothmes IV. slaying Asiatics.</em></div>
</div>

<p>Some time before he came to the throne he had
married a daughter of the King of Mitanni, a
North-Syrian state which acted as a buffer
between the Egyptian possessions in Syria and
the hostile lands of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia,
and which it was desirable, therefore, to placate
by such a union. There is little doubt that this
princess is to be identified with the Queen
Mutemua, of whom several monuments exist, and
who was the mother of Amonhotep III., the
son and successor of Thothmes IV. A foreign
element was thus introduced into the court which
much altered its character, and led to numerous
changes of a very radical nature. It may be that
this Asiatic influence induced the Pharaoh to give
further encouragement to the priest of Heliopolis.
The god Atum, the aspect of Ra as the setting
sun, was, as has been said, of common origin with
Aton or Adonis, who was largely worshipped in
North Syria; and the foreign queen with her
retinue may have therefore felt more sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with Heliopolis than with Thebes. Moreover,
it was the Asiatic tendency to speculate in
religious questions, and the doctrines of the
priests of the northern god were more flexible
and more adaptable to the thinker than was
the stiff, formal creed of Amon. Thus, the foreign
thought which had now been introduced into
Egypt, and especially into the palace, may have
contributed somewhat to the dissatisfaction with
the state religion which becomes apparent during
this reign.</p>

<p>Very little is known of the character of
Thothmes IV., and nothing which bears upon
that of his grandson Akhnaton is to be ascertained.
Although of feeble health and unmanly
physique, he was a fond upholder of the martial
dignity of Egypt. He delighted to honour the
memory of those Pharaohs of the past who had
achieved the greatest fame as warriors. Thus he
restored the monuments of Thothmes III., of
Aahmes I., and of Senusert III.,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the three
greatest military leaders of Egyptian history.
As a decoration for his chariot there were scenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
representing him trampling upon his foes; and
when he died many weapons of war were buried
with him. Of Queen Mutemua’s character
nothing is known; and the attention of the
reader may at once be carried on to Akhnaton’s
maternal grandparents, the father and mother
of Queen Tiy.</p>


<h3>5. YUAA AND TUAU.</h3>

<p>Somewhere about the year 1470 <span class="fs70">B.C.</span>, while the
great Thothmes III. was campaigning in Syria,
the child was born who was destined to become
the grandfather of the most remarkable of all
the Pharaohs of Egypt. Neither the names of
the parents nor the place of birth are known;
and the reader will presently find that it is not
easy to say whether the child was an Egyptian
or a foreigner. His name is written Aau, Aay,
Aai, Ayu, A-aa, Yaa, Yau, and most commonly
Yuaa; and this variety of spelling seems rather
to indicate that its pronunciation, being foreign,
did not permit of a correct rendering in Egyptian
letters. He must have been some twenty years
of age when Thothmes III. died; and thus it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
quite possible that he was one of those Syrian
princes whom the Pharaoh brought back to Egypt
from the courts of Asia to be educated in the
Egyptian manner. Some of these hostages who
were not direct heirs to Syrian thrones may
have taken up their permanent residence on the
banks of the Nile, where it is certain that a fair
number of their countrymen were settled for
business and other purposes. During the reign
of Amonhotep II., Yuaa must have passed the
prime years of his life, and at that king’s death
he had probably reached about the forty-fifth
year of his age. He had married a woman called
by the common Egyptian name of Tuau, regarding
whose nationality there is, therefore, not
much question. Two children were born of the
marriage, the first a boy who was named Aanen,
and the second a girl named Tiy, who later
became the great queen. Tiy was probably a
little girl some two years old when Thothmes IV.
came to the throne, and as her parents both
held appointments at court, she must have presently
received those first impressions of royal
luxury which influenced her childhood and her
whole life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_026_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Tuau, grandmother of Akhnaton.</em></div>
</div>

<p>At this time Yuaa held the sacerdotal office of
Priest of Min, one of the most ancient of the
Egyptian gods. Min, who had many of the
characteristics of, and was later identified with,
the Greek Pan, was worshipped at three or four
cities of Upper Egypt, and throughout the Eastern
Desert to the Red Sea coast. He was the god
of fecundity, fertility, generation, reproduction,
and the like, in the human, animal, and vegetable
worlds. In his form of Min-Ra he was a
god of the sun, whose fertilising rays made
pregnant the whole earth. He was more noble
than the Greek Pan, and represented the pristine
desires of lawful reproduction in the family, rather
than the erotic instincts for which the Greek
god was famous. Were one to compare him
with any of the gods of the countries neighbouring
to Egypt, he would be found to have as
much likeness to the above-mentioned Adonis,
who in North Syria was a god of vegetation,
as to any other deity. This fact offers food for
some thought, for if Yuaa was a foreigner, hailing,
as may be supposed, from Syria, there would
have been no Egyptian god, except Atum, to
whose service he would have attached himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
so readily as to that of Min. Although a tribal
god, Min was not essentially the protector and
upholder of Egyptian rights and Egyptian prejudices.
He was, in one form or another, universal;
and he must have appealed to the sense
and the senses of Syrian and Egyptian alike.</p>

<p>At this time, as we have seen, the priests of
Amon, whose wealth had brought corruption in
its train, were under the cloud of royal displeasure,
and the court was beginning to display
a desire to rid itself of an influence which
was daily becoming less exalted. It may be
that Yuaa, upholding the doctrines of Min and
of Adonis, had some connection with this movement,
for he was now a personage of considerable
importance at the palace. He may have
already held the title of Prince or Duke, by
which he is called in his funeral inscriptions;
and one may suppose that he was a favourite
of the young king, Thothmes IV., and of his
wife, Queen Mutemua, whose blood was soon
to unite with his own in the person of Akhnaton.
When Thothmes IV. died at the age of twenty-six,
and his son Amonhotep III., a boy of
twelve years of age, came to the throne, Yuaa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was a man of over fifty, and his little daughter
Tiy was a girl of marriageable age according
to Egyptian ideas, being about ten years old.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_028_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Chest belonging to Yuaa.</em></div>
</div>

<p>The court at this time was more or less under
the influence of the now Queen-Regent Mutemua
and her advisers, for Amonhotep III. was still
too young to be allowed to go entirely his own
way, and amongst those advisers it seems evident
that Yuaa was to be numbered. Now the boy-king
had not been on the throne more than a
year, if as much, when, with feasting and ceremony,
he was married to Tiy; and Yuaa and
Tuau became the proud parents-in-law of the
Pharaoh.</p>

<p>It is necessary to consider the significance of
the marriage. The royal pair were the merest
children; and it is impossible to suppose that
the marriage was not arranged for them by
their guardians. If Amonhotep at this early
age had simply fallen in love with this girl,
with whom probably he had been brought up,
he, no doubt, would have insisted on marrying
her, and she would have been placed in his
<em>harîm</em>. But she became his Great Queen, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
placed on the throne beside him, and received
honours which no other queen of the most
royal blood had ever received before. It is
clear that the king’s advisers would never have
permitted this had Tiy been but the pretty
daughter of a noble of the court. There must
have been something in her parentage which
entitled her to these honours and caused her
to be chosen deliberately as queen.</p>

<p>There are several possibilities. Tuau may have
had royal blood in her veins, and may have been,
for instance, the granddaughter of Thothmes
III., to whom she bears some likeness in face.
Queen Tiy is often called “Royal Daughter” as
well as “Royal Wife”; and it is possible that
this is to be taken literally. In a letter sent by
Dushratta, King of Mitanni, to Akhnaton, Tiy is
called “my sister and thy mother”; and though
it is possible that the word “sister” is here used
to indicate the general cousinship of royalty, it
is more probable that some real connection is
meant, for other relationships, such as “daughter,”
“wife,” and “father-in-law,” are precisely stated
in the letter. Yuaa may have been indirectly
of royal Egyptian blood, or he may have been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as we have seen, the offspring of some Syrian royal
house, such as that of Mitanni, related by marriage
with the Pharaoh; and thus Tiy may have had
some distant claim to the throne, and Dushratta
would have had reason for calling her his sister.
Queen Tiy, however, has so often been called a
foreigner for reasons which have now been shown
to be quite erroneous that we must be cautious in
adopting any of these possibilities. It has been
stated that her face is North-Syrian in type,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and,
as the portrait upon which this statement is based
is, in all features except the nose, reminiscent of
Yuaa, that noble would also resemble the people
of that country; and in this connection it must
be remembered that the marriage of Tiy and
Amonhotep took place under the regency of
Mutemua, herself probably a North-Syrian
princess. Be this as it may, however, the two
children, not yet in their ’teens, ruled Egypt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
together, and Yuaa and Tuau stood behind the
throne to advise them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_030_fp.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Queen Tiy.</em></div>
</div>

<p>Tuau now included amongst her titles those of
“Royal Handmaid,” or lady-in-waiting, “the
favoured-one of Hathor,” “the favourite of the
King,” and “the Royal mother of the great wife
of the King,” a title which may indicate that she
was of royal blood. Amongst the titles of Yuaa
one may mention those of “Master of the Horse
and Chariot-Captain of the King,” “the favourite,
excellent above all favourites,” and “the mouth
and ears of the King,”&mdash;that is to say, his agent
and adviser. He was a personage of commanding
presence, whose powerful character showed
itself in his face. One must picture him now as
a tall man, with a fine shock of white hair; a
great hooked nose, like that of a Syrian; full,
strong lips; and a prominent, determined jaw.
He has the face of an ecclesiastic, and there is
something about his mouth which reminds one of
the late Pope, Leo XIII. One feels, in looking
at his well-preserved features, that here perhaps
may be found the originator of the great religious
movement which his daughter and grandson
carried into execution.</p>

<h3>6. AMONHOTEP III. AND HIS COURT.</h3>

<p>Besides Yuaa and Tuau and the Queen-Dowager
Mutemua, there was a certain noble,
named Amonhotep-son-of-Hapu, who may have
exercised considerable influence upon the young
Pharaoh. So good and wise a man was he, that
in later times he was regarded almost as a
divinity, and his sayings were treasured from
generation to generation. It may be that he
furthered the cause of the Heliopolitan priesthood
against that of Amon; and it is to be
observed in this connection that, in the inscription
engraved upon his statue, he refers to the
Pharaoh as the “heir of Atum” and the “first-born
son of Horakhti,” those being the Heliopolitan
gods. When, presently, a daughter was
born to Tiy, who was named Setamon, this
philosopher was given the honorary post of
“Steward” to the princess; while at the same
time he filled the office of Minister of Public
Works, and held various court appointments.
At this period, when religious speculation was
beginning to be freely indulged in, the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of a “wise man” of this character would necessarily
be great; and should any of his sayings
come to light, they will perhaps be found to
bear upon the subject of the religious changes
which were now taking place. A late tradition
tells us that this Amonhotep had warned the
Pharaoh that if he would see the true God he
must drive from his kingdom all impure persons;
and herein one may perhaps observe some reference
to the corrupt priests of Amon, whose
ejection from their offices was daily becoming
more necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_034_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Amonhotep-son-of-Hapu, the “wise man” of the<br />
Court of Amonhotep III.</em></div>
</div>

<p>At the time of which we write Egypt still
remained at that height of power to which the
military skill of Thothmes III. had raised her.
The Kings of Palestine and Syria were tributaries
to the young Pharaoh; the princes of the
sea-coast cities sent their yearly impost to
Thebes; Cyprus, Crete, and even the Greek
islands, were Egyptianised; Sinai and the Red
Sea coast as far south as Somaliland were included
in the Pharaoh’s dominions; and the
negro tribes of the Sudan were his slaves. Egypt
was indeed the greatest state in the world, and
Thebes was a metropolis at which the ambassadors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the merchants, and the artisans from
these various countries met together. Here
they could look upon buildings undreamed of
in their own lands, and could participate in
luxuries unknown even in Babylon. The wealth
of Egypt was so enormous that a foreign sovereign
who wrote to the Pharaoh asking for gold
mentioned that it could not be considered as
anything more valuable than so much dust by
an Egyptian. Golden vases in vast quantities
adorned the tables of the king and his nobles,
and hundreds of golden vessels of different kinds
were used in the temples.</p>

<p>The splendour and gaiety of the court at
Thebes remind one of the tales from the Arabian
Nights. One reads of banquets, of splendid
festivals on the water, of jubilee celebrations,
and of hunting parties. When the scenes depicted
on the monuments are gathered together
in the mind, and the ruins which are left are
there reconstructed, a life of the most intense
brilliancy is shown. This was rather a development
of the period than a condition of things
which had been derived from an earlier <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>.
The Egyptians had always been a happy, light-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
people; but it was the conquests of
Thothmes III. that had given them the security
and the wealth to live as luxuriously as they
pleased. The tendency of the nation was now
to break away from the old, hardy traditions of
the earlier periods of Egyptian history; and
virtually no other body, except the priesthood
of Amon, held them down to ancient conventionalities.
But while the king and his court
made merry and amused themselves in sumptuous
fashion, that god Amon and his representatives
towered over them like some sombre bogie, holding
them to a religion which they considered to be
obsolete, and claiming its share of royal wealth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_036_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
CEILING DECORATION FROM THE PALACE OF AMONHOTEP III.</div>
</div>

<p>About the time of his marriage Amonhotep
built a palace on the western bank of the Nile,
on the edge of the desert under the Theban
hills, and here Queen Tiy held her brilliant
court. The palace was a light but roomy structure
of brick and costly woods, exquisitely decorated
with paintings on stucco, and embellished
with delicate columns. Along one side ran a
balcony on which were rugs and many-coloured
cushions, and here the king and queen could
sometimes be seen by their subjects. Gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
surrounded the palace, almost at the gates of
which rose the splendid hills. On the eastern
side of the building the king later constructed
a huge pleasure-lake especially for the amusement
of Tiy. The mounds of earth which were
thrown up during its excavation were purposely
formed into irregular hills, and these were covered
with trees and flowers. Here the queen floated
in her barge, which, in honour of the Heliopolitan
god, she called “Aton-gleams”; and as
she watched the reflections of the hills and the
trees in the still water, she may well have
imagined herself in those fair lands of Syria
from which Aton or Adonis had come.</p>

<p>The name Aton was Syrian. The setting sun,
as we have seen, was called in Egypt Atum,
which was derived from the Asiatic Adon or
Aton; and it is now that we first find the word
introduced into Egypt as a synonym of Ra-Horakhti-Khepera-Atum
of Heliopolis. Presently
we find that one of the Pharaoh’s
regiments of soldiers is named after this god
Aton, and here and there the word now occurs
upon the monuments. Thus, gradually, the court
was bringing a new-named deity into prominence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
closely related to the gods of Heliopolis; and
it may be supposed that the priesthood of
Amon watched the development with considerable
perturbation. The Pharaoh himself does
not seem to have worried very considerably with
regard to these religious matters. He was, it
seems, a man addicted to pleasure, whose interests
lay as much in the hunting-field as in the
palace. He loved to boast that during the first
ten years of his reign he had slain 102 lions;
but as he was a mere boy when he first indulged
in this form of sport, it is to be presumed
that his nobles assisted him handsomely
in the slaughter on each occasion. In one day
he is reported to have killed fifty-six wild
cattle, and a score more fell to him a few days
later; but here again one may suppose that the
glory and not the deed was his.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_038_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Site of the Palace of Queen Tiy.</em></div>
</div>

<p>In the fifth year of his reign he led an expedition
into the Sudan to chastise some tribe
which had rebelled, and he records with pride the
slaughter which he had made. It is stated that
these negroes “had been haughty, and great
things were in their hearts; but the fierce-eyed
lion, this prince, he slew them by the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of Amon-Atum.” It is interesting to notice that
Atum is thus brought into equal prominence with
Amon, and one may see from this the trend of
public opinion.</p>

<p>At this time the Vizir, a certain Ptahmes, held
also the office of High Priest of Amon; but
when he died he was not succeeded in his duties
as Vizir by the new head of the Amon priesthood,
as was to be expected. The Pharaoh appointed
a noble named Rames as his prime minister, and
thus separated the civil and the religious power:
a step which again shows us something of the
movement which was steadily diminishing the
power of Amon.</p>

<p>Queen Tiy seems to have borne several
daughters to the king, and it is possible that
she had also presented him with a son. But, if
this is so, he had died in early childhood, and no
heir to the throne was now living. It may have
been partly due to this fact that Amonhotep, in
the tenth year of his reign, married the Princess
Kirgipa or Gilukhipa, daughter of the King of
Mitanni, and probably niece of the Dowager-Queen
Mutemua.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The princess came to Egypt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in considerable state, bringing with her 317
ladies-in-waiting; but she seems to have been
thrust into the background by Tiy, who, even
in the official record of the marriage, is called
the king’s chief wife. The marriage may have
been purely political, as was that of Thothmes
IV.; and there is certainly no record of any
children born to Gilukhipa. She and her ladies
but added a further foreign element to the life
of the palace, and swelled the numbers of those
who had no sympathy with the old gods of
Thebes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_040_fp.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Coffin of Yuaa.</em></div>
</div>

<p>It must have been somewhere about the year
1390 <span class="fs70">B.C.</span> that Tiy’s aged father, Yuaa, died;
and Tuau soon followed him to the grave. They
were buried in a fine sepulchre in the Valley
of the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes; and if
they are not to be considered as royal, this will
have been the first time that persons not of
royal blood had been buried in a tomb of large
size in this valley. A quantity of funeral furniture
was placed around the splendid coffins in which
their mummies lay, and amongst this there were
a few objects which evidently had been presented
by the bereaved king and queen and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the young princesses, Setamon and another whose
name is now lost. Yuaa and his wife had evidently
been much beloved at the court, and as
the parents of the great queen they had commanded
the respect of all men. To us they are
remarkable as the grandparents of that great
teacher, Akhnaton, whose birth has now to be
recorded.</p>

<h3>1. THE BIRTH OF AKHNATON.</h3>


<p class="noindent">It has been seen that Queen Tiy presented
several children to the king; but it was not
until they had reigned some twenty-five or
twenty-six years that the future monarch was
born. As the years had passed the queen must
have grown more and more anxious for a son,
and many must have been the prayers she offered
up that a male child might be vouchsafed to
her. In Egypt at the present day the desire
to bear a son holds dominion in the heart of
every young woman; and those to whom this
privilege has not been granted forsake the laws
of the prophet and still lay their passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
appeal before the old gods. The present writer
was asked recently by a young peasant to allow
his wife to walk round the outer wall of an
ancient temple, in order that she might perchance
bear a male child thereafter; and on another
occasion three young women were seen
sliding down the plinth of an overturned statue
of Rameses the Great for the same purpose.
With similar emotion, though with greater intelligence,
Queen Tiy must have turned in her grief
from one god to another, promising them all
manner of gifts if they would grant her desire.
To Ra-Horakhti Aton she appears to have
turned with the most confidence; and perhaps,
as will presently be seen, she vowed that if a
son were granted to her she would dedicate him
to the service of that god.</p>

<p>It is probable that the little prince first saw
the light in the royal palace at Thebes, which
was situated on the edge of the desert at the
foot of the western hills. It was, as has been
said, an extensive building, lightly constructed
and gaily decorated. The ceilings and pavements
of its halls were fantastically painted
with scenes of animal life: wild cattle ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
through reedy swamps beneath the royal feet,
and there many-coloured fish swam in the water;
while overhead flights of pigeons, white against
a blue sky, passed across the hall, and wild
duck hastened towards the open casements.
Through curtained doorways one might obtain
glimpses of the garden planted with flowers
foreign to Egypt; and on the east of the palace
shone the great pleasure-lake, surrounded by the
trees of Asia.</p>

<p>In all the world there are few places more
beautiful than the site of this palace. Here one
may sit for many an hour watching the changing
colours on the wonderful cliffs, the pink and
the yellow of the rocks standing out from the
blue and the purple of the deep shadows. In
the fields which now surround the ruined palace,
where the royal gardens were laid out, one obtains
an impression of colour, of beauty, and of gaiety&mdash;if
it can be so expressed&mdash;which is not easily
equalled. The continuous sunshine and the
bracing wind render one intensely awake to
natural joys; and here, indeed, was a fitting
birthplace, one feels, for a king who taught his
people to study the beauties of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<h3>2. THE RISE OF ATON.</h3>

<p>The little prince was named Amonhotep,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> “the
Peace-of-Amon,” after his father; but though
the supremacy of Amon was thus acknowledged,
the Heliopolitan deity appears to have been considered
as the protector of the young boy. While
the luxurious court rejoiced at the birth of their
future king, one feels that the ancient priesthood
of Amon-Ra must have looked askance at the
baby who was destined one day to be their
master. This priesthood still demanded implicit
obedience to its stiff and ancient conventions,
and it refused to recognise the growing tendency
towards religious speculation.</p>

<p>Probably stronger measures would have been
taken by it to resist the growing power of Ra-Horakhti,
had it not been for the fact that Ra
was also a form of Amon, and had been identified
with him under the name of Amon-Ra. The
god Amon was originally but the local deity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Thebes; and, when the Theban Pharaohs of the
Eighteenth Dynasty had elevated him to the position
of the state god of all Egypt, they made
him acceptable to the various provinces, as we have
seen, by pointing to his identification with Ra, the
sun-god, who, under one form or another, found
a place in every temple and held high rank in
every variety of mythology. As Amon-Ra he
was able to be appreciated by the sun-worshippers
of Syria and by those of Nubia, for there were
few races who would not do homage to the great
giver of warmth and light.</p>

<p>It is possible that those more thoughtful
members of the court who were quietly attempting
to undermine the influence of the priesthood
of Amon, and who were beginning to carry into
execution the schemes of emancipation which we
have already noticed, now endeavoured to strip
Amon of his association with the sun; for that
identity was really his simple claim to acceptance
by any but Thebans. The priesthood, on their
part, it may be supposed, drew as much attention
as possible to the connection of their deity with
Ra; for they knew that none but the Heliopolitan
god could be advanced with success as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
rival of Amon by those who desired to overthrow
the Theban god. Thus one finds that the High
Priest of Ra at Heliopolis was given, and was
obliged to accept, the honorary office of Second
Priest of Amon at Thebes,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which at once placed
him under the thumb of the Theban High Priest.
The propounders of the new thought, however,
met this move by bringing into greater prominence
the claims, not of Ra-Horakhti, but of
Aton, which was merely a more elusive form of
the sun-god. The priesthood of Amon had
always checked the individual growth of Ra-Horakhti
by regarding him simply as an aspect
of Ra, and hence of Amon-Ra. One of the
essential features of the new movement was the
regarding of Ra as an aspect of Ra-Horakhti,
and the calling of Ra-Horakhti by the uncontaminated
name of Aton. Aton, in fact, was
originally introduced into the matter largely for
the purpose of preventing any identification
between Amon-Ra and Ra-Horakhti. Soon the
name of Aton, entirely supplanting that of Atum,
was heard with some frequency at Thebes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
elsewhere, but always, it must be remembered,
as another word for Ra-Horakhti.</p>

<p>The desire of the court for a change of
religion is understandable. The cult of the
god Amon, as has been said, was so hedged
about with conventionalities that free thought
was impossible. We have seen, however, that
the upper classes were passing through a
phase of religious speculation, and they were
ready to revolt against the domination of a
priesthood which forbade criticism. The worship
of the intangible power of the sun, under the
name of Aton, offered endless possibilities for
the exercise of those tendencies towards the
abstract which were now beginning to be felt
all over the civilised world. This was man’s
first age of philosophical thought, and for the
first time in history the gods were being endued
with ideal qualities.</p>

<p>Apart from all questions of religion, the
priesthood of Amon had obtained such power
and wealth that it was a very serious menace
to the dignity of the throne. The great organisation
which had its headquarters at Karnak
had become an incubus which weighed heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
upon the state. For political reasons alone,
therefore, it was desirable to push the priests
of Heliopolis into a more prominent position.</p>

<p>There was, moreover, a third consideration.
The god Aton, with whom Ra and Ra-Horakhti
were now being identified, was, we have seen,
originally the same as the Syrian and Greek
Adonis, the word “Adon” or “Aton” meaning
simply “lord.” Thus the propounders of the
new doctrines must have dreamt of an Egypto-Syrian
empire bound together by the ties of a
common religion. With one god understood and
worshipped from the cataracts of the Nile to
the distant Euphrates, what power could destroy
the empire?</p>


<h3>3. THE POWER OF QUEEN TIY.</h3>

<p>In Amonhotep III. one may see the lazy,
speculative Oriental, too opinionated and too
vain to bear with the stiff routine of his
fathers, and yet too lacking in energy to
formulate a new religion. On the other hand,
there is every reason to suppose that Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Tiy possessed the ability to impress the claims
of the new thought upon her husband’s mind,
and gradually to turn his eyes, and those of
the court, away from the sombre worship of
Amon, “the unknown god,” into the direction
of the brilliant cult of the sun. Those who
have travelled in Egypt will realise how completely
the land is dominated by the sun.
The blue skies, the shining rocks, the golden
desert, the verdant fields, all seem to cry out
for joy of the sunshine. The extraordinary
energy which one may feel in Egypt at
sunrise, and the deep melancholy which sometimes
accompanies the red nightfall, must have
been felt by Tiy also in her palace at Thebes.</p>

<p>As the years passed the power and influence
of Queen Tiy increased; and now that she
had borne a son to the king there was added
to her great position as royal wife the equally
great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of royal mother. Never before
had a queen been so freely represented on
all the king’s monuments, nor had so fine a
series of titles been given before to the wife
of a Pharaoh. At Sedênga, far up in the
Sudan, her husband erected a temple for her;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and in distant Sinai a beautiful portrait head
of her was recently found. All visitors to
Thebes have seen her figures by the side of
the legs of the two great colossi at the edge
of the Western Desert; and the huge statues
of herself and her husband, now in the Cairo
Museum, will have been seen by those who
have visited that collection. Of Grilukhipa,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
however, and the king’s other wives, one hears
nothing at all: Queen Tiy relegated them to
the background almost before their marriage
ceremonies were over.</p>

<p>By the time that Amonhotep III. had reigned
for thirty years or so, he had ceased to give
much attention to state affairs, and the power
had almost entirely passed into the capable
hands of Tiy. Already an influence, which we
may presume to have been to a large extent
hers, was being felt in many directions: Ra-Horakhti
and Aton were being brought into
the foreground, a tone of thought which can
hardly be regarded as purely Egyptian was
being developed, the art was undergoing modifications
and had risen to a pitch of excellence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
never attained before or after. The exquisite
low-reliefs of the end of the reign of Amonhotep
III.&mdash;for example, those to be seen at Thebes
in the tombs of Khaemhat and Rames,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> both
of which are definitely dated to the close of
the reign&mdash;stir one almost as do the works of
the early Florentine masters. There is an elusive
grace in the dainty figures there sculptured,
which, through another medium and under other
laws of convention, cause them to appeal with
the same force of indefinable sweetness as do
the figures in the works of Filipino Lippi and
Botticelli. In the mass of Egyptian painting
and sculpture of secondary importance such gems
as these have been overlooked and have not
been appreciated by the public; but the present
writer ventures to think that some day they will
set the heart of all art-lovers dancing as danced
those of Queen Tiy’s great masters.</p>

<p>The court in which the little prince passed
his earliest years was more brilliant than ever
it had been before, and Queen Tiy presided over
scenes of indescribable splendour. Amonhotep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
III. has been truly called “the Magnificent”;
and at no period, save that of Thothmes III.,
were the royal treasuries so full or the nobles so
wealthy. Out of a pageant of festivities, from
amidst the noise of song and laughter, the little
sad-eyed prince first emerges on to the stage
of history, led by the hand of Queen Tiy; but
as he appears before us, above the clink of the
golden wine-bowls, above the sound of the
timbrels, one seems to hear the lilt of a more
simple song, and the peaceful singing of a lark.</p>


<h3>4. AKHNATON’S MARRIAGE.</h3>

<p>During the last years of his reign the Pharaoh,
although well under fifty years of age,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> seems to
have suffered from permanent ill-health. On
two occasions the King of Mitanni sent to
Egypt a miracle-working statuette of the goddess
Ishtar, apparently in the hope that Amonhotep
might be cured of his illness by it. It
is probable that the king had never been a very
strong man. Having been born when his father&mdash;himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
extremely delicate&mdash;was but a child,
he had had little chance of enjoying a robust
middle age, and he passed on to his children
this inherent weakness. One hears no more of
his daughters,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> whom we have seen mourning
for their grandparents Yuaa and Tuau, and
there is some likelihood that they died young.
The little Prince Amonhotep was already developing
constitutional weaknesses which rendered
his life very precarious. His skull was
misshapen, and he must have been subject to
occasional epileptic fits. And now Queen Tiy
gave birth to a daughter, who was named
Baketaton in honour of the new god, and who
seems to have lived less than a score of years,
since nothing more is heard of her after her
twelfth or thirteenth year.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_054_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Amonhotep III.</em></div>
</div>

<p>As Amonhotep, at the age of forty-eight or
forty-nine, felt his end approaching, he seems
to have shown considerable anxiety in regard
to the succession. Here was his only son&mdash;now
a boy of ten or eleven years of age&mdash;in so sad
a state of health that he could not be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to live to manhood, and in the event of his
death the throne would be without an occupant
in the direct line. Obviously it was necessary
that he should be married as soon as possible, in
order that he might become a father as early
as that was naturally possible. Amonhotep III.
himself had been married to Tiy when he was
about twelve years of age, and his father Thothmes
IV. had likewise been married at that
early age.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The little Prince Amonhotep should,
therefore, also be given a wife at once; and the
Pharaoh now began to look around for a suitable
consort for him. He had heard that
Dushratta, King of Mitanni, had a small
daughter who was said to be a comely maiden;
but it appears that she was only eight or nine
years of age,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and therefore could not be expected
to provide an heir for at least another
four years. Nevertheless there were many political
reasons for proposing the union. Mitanni
was, as we have seen, the buffer state between
the Pharaoh’s Syrian possessions and the lands of
the Hittites and of the Mesopotamians. Thothmes
IV. had asked a bride from Mitanni, and Amonhotep
III. himself had obtained Gilukhipa from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
thence, if not Queen Tiy also: both these being
probably political matches, designed for the welfare
of the Syrian empire. The Pharaoh therefore
decided upon this marriage for his sickly
son, and sent an embassy to Dushratta to
negotiate the union between these two children.</p>

<p>The reply of Dushratta has, fortunately, been
preserved to us. The Mitannian king acknowledges
the arrival of the envoy, and is much
rejoiced at this further binding together of the
two countries. In a subsequent letter it is evident
that the princess has already been sent to
Egypt, and we are led to suppose that Prince
Amonhotep has at once been married to her.
The little princess was named Tadukhipa, but
on her arrival in Egypt she was renamed
Nefertiti. Her age, as mentioned above, is apparent
from the fact that, although in after life
she gave birth to children at very regular
intervals, her first child was not born until nearly
five years after her marriage.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> So young was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
she that she did not at once cohabit with the
prince, but was put under the care of a certain
lady of the court named Ty, the wife of a noble
of the name of Ay, who afterwards usurped the
throne. This lady Ty called herself in later
years “great nurse and nourisher of the Queen,”
and Ay always called himself the king’s father-in-law
(<em>neter at</em>). It would thus seem that they
had become the actual foster-parents of the little
Syrian girl. It was not at all unusual in Egypt
for a child to be adopted thus; and it is a
curious fact that if a woman gave the breast to
a child of any age but for a moment, or if a man
placed his finger in the child’s mouth, a formal
adoption was considered to have been made.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The court had hardly settled down after the
celebration of the marriage of Amonhotep and
Tadukhipa-Nefertiti, when it was thrown into
mourning by the death of Amonhotep “the
Magnificent,” which occurred in the thirty-sixth
year of his reign. Queen Tiy at once assumed
control of state affairs, on behalf of her barely
eleven-year-old son, who as Amonhotep IV. now
ascended the throne of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3>5. THE ACCESSION OF AKHNATON.</h3>

<p>On coming to the throne the young king
fixed his titulary in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mighty Bull, Lofty of Plumes; Favourite of the
Two Goddesses, Great in Kingship in Karnak;
Golden Hawk, Wearer of Diadems in the Southern
Heliopolis; King of Upper and Lower Egypt,
Beautiful-is-the-Being-of-Ra, the Only-One-of-Ra;
Son of the Sun, Peace-of-Amon (Amonhotep),
Divine Ruler of Thebes; Great in Duration, Living
for Ever and Ever, Beloved of Amon-Ra, Lord of
Heaven.</p></div>

<p>These titles were drawn up on more or less
prescribed lines, and conformed to the old custom
of the Pharaohs. Like his ancestors, he was
called “Beloved of Amon-Ra,” although, as we
have seen, the power of that god was already
much undermined. To counterbalance this reference
to the god of Thebes, however, one finds
the surprising title&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="negin2">High Priest of Ra-Horakhti, rejoicing in the horizon
in his name, “Heat-which-is-in-Aton.”</p></div>

<p>Let the boy be said to be beloved of Amon-Ra
till the walls of Thebes reverberate with the cry;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
let Amon-Ra be called Lord of Heaven till the
priestly heralds can shout no more: the doom of
the god of Thebes cannot now be averted, for the
reigning Pharaoh is dedicated to another god.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_058_fp.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Akhnaton.</em></div>
</div>

<p>It is obvious that a boy of eleven years of age
could not himself have claimed the office of the
High Priest of Ra-Horakhti. Queen Tiy and
her advisers must have deliberately endowed the
youthful king with this office, largely in order
to set the seal upon the fate of Amon. There
were, perhaps, other reasons why this remarkable
step was decided upon. It may be, as has been
said, that the queen, before the birth of her
son, had vowed him to Ra-Horakhti. Again, the
boy was epileptic, was subject to hallucinations;
and it may be that while in this condition he
had seen visions or uttered words which led his
mother to believe him to be the chosen one of the
Heliopolitan god, whose name the prince must
have been constantly hearing. In a palace where
the mystical “Heat-which-is-in-Aton,” which was
the new elaboration of the god’s name, was
being daily invoked, and where the youthful
master of Egypt was constantly falling into
what appeared to be holy frenzy, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
unlikely that the rising deity would be connected
with the eccentricities of the young
Pharaoh. The High Priest of Ra-Horakhti was
always called “The Great of Visions,” and was
thus essentially a visionary prophet either by
nature or by circumstance; and the unfortunate
boy’s physical condition may have been turned,
thus, to account in the struggle against Amon-Ra.</p>

<p>One may now imagine the Pharaoh as a pale,
sickly youth. His head seemed too large for
his body; his eyelids were heavy; his eyes as
one imagines them were wells of dream. His
features were delicately moulded, and his mouth,
in spite of a somewhat protruding lower jaw,
is reminiscent of the best of the art of Rossetti.
He seems to have been a quiet, studious boy,
whose thoughts wandered in fair places, searching
for that happiness which his physical condition
had denied to him. His nature was
gentle; his young heart overflowed with love.
He delighted, it would seem, to walk in the
gardens of the palace, to hear the birds singing,
to watch the fish in the lake, to smell the
flowers, to follow the butterflies, to warm his
small bones in the sunshine. There was a grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
dignity in his gait, or the artists have lied; and
his words were already fraught with wisdom.
The great crown of the Pharaohs sat easily
upon his head, for his every movement was
royal. He accepted as his due the homage of
the court; yet he does not seem to have acted
with arrogance, and was ever a tender-hearted,
impulsive child. Already he was sometimes
called “Lord of the Breath of Sweetness”;<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and already he was so much beloved by his
subjects that their adherence to him through
the rough places of his future life was assured.
For the first years of his reign he was, of
course, entirely under the regency of his mother.
Dushratta, the King of Mitanni, writing to congratulate
the boy on his accession, addressed
himself to Queen Tiy, as though he thought
the king would hardly yet be able to understand
a letter; and in a later communication he asks
the Pharaoh to inquire of his mother as to
certain matters of international policy. But
although so young, the king was wise beyond
his years, as the reader will presently see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<h3>6. THE FIRST YEARS OF AKHNATON’S REIGN.</h3>

<p>In a subsequent chapter it will be the writer’s
purpose to show to what heights of ideal thought,
and to what profundities of religious and moral
philosophy, this boy, in the years of his early
manhood, attained; and it will but enhance our
respect for his abilities when he reached maturity,
if we find in his early training all manner of
shortcomings. The beautiful doctrines of the religion
with which this Pharaoh’s name is identified
were productions of his later days; and until
he was at least seventeen years of age neither
his exalted monotheism nor any of his future
principles were really apparent. Some time after
the eighth year of his reign one finds that he
had evolved a religion so pure that one must
compare it with Christianity in order to discover
its faults; and the reader will presently see that
this superb theology was not derived from his
education.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the king’s reign, undertaken
at the desire of Queen Tiy or of the royal
advisers, was the erection of a temple to Ra-Horakhti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Aton at Karnak.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This was in no
way an insult to Amon, for Thothmes III. and
other Pharaohs had dedicated temples at Karnak
to gods other than Amon. The priesthood
of Amon-Ra recognised the existence of the
many deities of Egypt, and gave them their
place in the constitution of heaven, reserving
for their own god the title of “King of the
Gods.” There was a temple of Ptah here; there
were shrines set apart for the worship of Min;
and other gods, unconnected with Amon, were
here accommodated. The priests of Amon-Ra
thus could not offer any serious objection to
the project. The building<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> was to be constructed
of sandstone, and therefore various officials were
dispatched to the great quarries of Gebel Silsileh,
which lie on the river between Edfu and Kom
Ombo, and to those near Esneh. Large tablets
were there carved upon the cliffs towards the
close of the work, and on them the figure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Pharaoh was represented worshipping Amon, who
was thus still the state god. Above the king’s
figure, however, the disk of the sun is seen, and
from it a number of lines, representing rays, project
downwards towards the royal figure. These rays
terminate in hands, which thus seem to be distributing
the “Heat-which-is-in-Aton” around
the Pharaoh. This is the first representation of
the afterwards famous symbol of the religion of
Aton, and it is significant that it should make its
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> in a scene representing the worship of Amon.</p>

<p>The king is called the High Priest of Ra-Horakhti;
but the title “Living in truth,” which
he took to himself in later years, and which had
reference to the religion of Aton which he was
soon to evolve, does not yet appear.</p>

<p>A large number of fragments from this shrine
have been discovered, and on these one sees
references to the gods Horus, Set, Wepwat,
and others. The king is still called by the
name Amonhotep, which was later banned, and
the names of Aton, afterwards always written
within the royal ovals or cartouches, are still
lacking in that distinction. The temple was
called “Aton-is-found-in-the-House-of-Aton,” a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
curious name of which the meaning is not clear.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
A certain official named Hataay was “Scribe
and Overseer of the Granary of the House of the
Aton,” by which this temple is probably meant;
and in the tomb of Rames a reference is made
to the building by its full name, and a picture
of it is given, but otherwise one knows little
about it. The rapidity with which it was desired
to be set up is shown by the fact that the great,
well-trimmed blocks of stone usually employed
in the construction of sacred buildings were
largely dispensed with, and only small easily-handled
blocks were used. The imperfections in
the building were then hidden by a judicious
use of plaster and cement, and thus the walls
were smoothed for the reception of the reliefs.
The quarter in which the temple stood was now
called “Brightness of Aton the Great,” and
Thebes received the new name of “City of the
Brightness of Aton.”</p>

<p>There are two other monuments which date
from these early years of the king’s reign: both
are tombs of great nobles. At this period one
of the greatest personages in the land was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
above-mentioned Rames, the Vizir of Upper
Egypt. This official was now engaged in constructing
and decorating a magnificent sepulchre
for himself in the Theban necropolis. In the
great hall of this tomb the artists were busy
preparing the beautiful sculptures and paintings
which were to cover the walls, and ere half
their work was finished they set themselves to
the making of a fine figure of Amonhotep IV.
seated upon his throne, with the goddess Maat
standing behind him. The scene was probably
executed a few months before the making of
the tablets at the quarries. The sun’s rays do
not appear, and the work was carried out strictly
according to the canons of art obtaining during
the last years of Amonhotep III. and the first
of his son. But hardly had the figures been
finished before the order came that the Aton
rays had to be included, and certain changes
in the art had to be recognised; and therefore
the artists set to work upon another figure of
the king standing under these many-handed
beams of “heat,” and now accompanied by his, as
yet, childless wife. The two scenes may be seen
by visitors to Thebes standing side by side, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nowhere may the contrast between the old order
of things and the new be so clearly observed.</p>

<p>While Rames was providing a tomb for
himself at Thebes, another great noble named
Horemheb, who ultimately usurped the throne,
was constructing his sepulchre at Sakkârah,
the Memphite necropolis near Cairo. Horemheb
was commander-in-chief of the army, and
in his tomb some superb reliefs are carved
showing him receiving rewards in that capacity
from the king. Some of the scenes represent
the arrival of Asiatic refugees in Egypt, who
ask to be allowed to take up their abode on
the banks of the Nile, and the figures of these
foreigners rank amongst the finest specimens of
Egyptian art. In the inscriptions, Horemheb,
who is supposed to be addressing the king,
states that the Pharaoh owes his throne to
Amon,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but yet we see that the figure of the
king is drawn in that style of art which is
typical of the new religion.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<h3>7. THE NEW ART.</h3>

<p>This sudden change in the style of the reliefs
which we have observed in these two tombs
and on the quarry tablets seems to be attributable
to about the fourth year of the king’s
reign. The reliefs which were now carved
upon the walls of the new temple of Ra-Horakhti
at Karnak show us a style of art
quite different from that of the king’s early years.
The figure of the Pharaoh, which the artists
in the tomb of Rames represented as standing
below the newly-invented sun’s rays, is as
different from the earlier figure there executed
as chalk is from cheese. The Pharaoh whom
we see in the tomb of Horemheb and on the
quarry tablets is represented, according to
canons of art, entirely different from those
existing at the king’s accession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>In the drawing of the human figure, and
especially that of the Pharaoh, there are three
very distinct characteristics in this new style
of art. Firstly, as to the head: the skull is
elongated; the chin, as seen in profile, is drawn
as though it were sharply pointed; the flesh
under the jaw is skimped, thus giving an
upward turn to the line; and the neck is
represented as being long and thin. Secondly,
the stomach is made to obtrude itself upon
the attention by being drawn as though from
a fat and ungainly model. And thirdly, the
hips and thighs are abnormally large, though
from the knee downwards the legs are of more
natural size. This distortion of human anatomy
is marked in a lesser degree in all
the lines of the body; and the whole figure
becomes a startling type of an art which seems
at first to have sprung fully developed from
the brain of the boy-Pharaoh or from one of
the eccentrics of the court.</p>

<p>The king was now fifteen years old, and
seems to have been extraordinarily mature for
his age. It may be that he had objected to
be represented in the conventional manner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
had told his artists to draw him as he was.
The elongated skull, the pointed chin, and
even, perhaps, the protruding paunch, may
thus have originated. But the ungainly thighs
could only be accounted for by some radical
deformity in the royal model, and that he was
a well-made man in this respect his recently
discovered bones most clearly show.</p>

<p>Purely tentatively a suggestion may here be
offered to account for this peculiar treatment of
the human body. It is probable that the king
had now, in a boyish way, become deeply interested
in the religious contest which was beginning
to be waged between Amon-Ra and
Ra-Horakhti Aton. Having listened to the
arguments on both sides, it may have occurred
to him to study for himself the ancient documents
and inscriptions bearing on the matter. In so
doing, he would have found that Amon had
become the state god only some few hundred
years before his own time, and that previous to
his ascent to this important position, previous
even to the earliest mention of his name, Ra-Horakhti
had been supreme. Carrying his
inquiries back, past the days of the pyramid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
kings to the archaic Pharaohs who reigned at
the dim beginning of things, he would still have
found the Heliopolitan god worshipped. One
of the Pharaohs’ most cherished titles was “Son
of the Sun,” which, as we have seen, had been
borne by each successive sovereign since the
days of the Fifth Dynasty, whose kings claimed
descent from Ra himself. Such studies would
inevitably bring two matters into prominence:
firstly, that Amon was, after all, but a usurper;
and, secondly, that as Pharaoh he was the
descendant of Ra-Horakhti, and was that god’s
representative on earth.</p>

<p>On these grounds, more than on any others,
all things connected with Amon would become
distasteful to him. He was too young to understand
fully which of the two religions was the
better morally or theologically; but he was
old enough to be moved by the romance of
history, and to feel that those great, shadowy
Pharaohs who lived when the world was young,
and who at the dawn of events worshipped the
sun, were the truest and best examples for him
to follow. They were his ancestors, and as they
were the sons of Ra, so he, too, was the proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
descendant of that great god. In his veins
there ran the blood of the sun, that “Heat-which-is-in-Aton”
pulsed through and through
him; and the more he read in those old documents
the more he was stirred by the glory
of that distant past when men worshipped the
god whose rights Amon had usurped. Now the
canons of art were regarded as a distinctly
religious institution, and the methods of treating
the human figure then in vogue had in the first
place the sanction of the priesthood of Amon;
and few things would be more upsetting to
their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> than the abandoning of these canons.
This was probably recognised by those who
were furthering the cause of Ra-Horakhti, and
the young king may have been assisted and
encouraged in his views. Presently it may
have been brought home to him that, since he
was thus the representative of those archaic
kings and the High Priest of their god, it was
fitting that the canons acknowledged by those
far-off ancestors should be recognised by him.
Here, then, he would both please his own
romantic fancy and deal a blow at the Amon
priesthood by banning the art which they upheld,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>and by infusing into the sculptures and paintings
of his time something of the spirit of the
most ancient art of Egypt.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the old temples of Heliopolis and elsewhere
a few relics of that period, no doubt, were still
preserved; and the king was thus able to study
the wood and slate carvings and the ivory
figures of archaic times. We of the present
day can also study such figures, a few specimens
having been brought to light by modern excavators;
and the similarity between the treatment
of the human body in this archaic art and
the new art of Akhnaton at once becomes
apparent. In the accompanying illustrations
some archaic figures are shown, and one may
perhaps see in them the origin of the idiosyncrasies
of the new school. Here and in all
representations of archaic men one sees the
elongated skull so characteristic of the king’s
style; in the ivory figure of an archaic Pharaoh
one sees the well-known droop of Akhnaton’s
head and his pointed chin; in the clay and
ivory figures is the prominent stomach; and
here also, most apparent of all, are the unaccountably
large thighs and ponderous hips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Akhnaton’s art might thus be said to be
a kind of renaissance&mdash;a return to the classical
period of archaic days; the underlying motive
of this return being the desire to lay
emphasis upon the king’s character as the
representative of that most ancient of all
gods, Ra-Horakhti.</p>

<p>Another feature of the new religion now
becomes apparent. In the worship of Ra-Horakhti
Aton there was an endeavour to
do honour to the Pharaoh as the son of the
sun, and to the god as the founder of the
royal line. Tradition stated that Ra or Ra-Horakhti
had once reigned upon earth, and
that his spirit had passed from Pharaoh to
Pharaoh. This god was thus the only true
King of Heaven, and Amon was but a usurper
of much more recent date. It was for this
reason that the names of the new god were
placed within royal cartouches; and for this
reason the king was so careful to call Ra-Horakhti
his “father,” and to name him “god
and king.” For this reason also Akhnaton often
wore the crown of Lower Egypt which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
used at Heliopolis, but never the crown of
Upper Egypt, which history told him did not
exist when Ra ruled on earth.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Apart from the representation of the human
form, the new art is chiefly characterised by
its freedom of poses. An attempt is made to
break away from tradition, and a desire is
shown to have done with the conventions of
the age. Never before had the artists caught
the swing of a walk, the relaxation of a
seated figure, so well or so truthfully. Sculpture
in the round now reached a height of
perfection which places it above all but the
art of the Greeks in the old world; and
there is a grace and naturalness in the low-reliefs
which command one’s admiration.</p>

<p>There are only two artists of the period
who are known by name. The one was a
certain Auta, who is represented in a relief
dating from some eight years after the change
in the art had taken place. It is a significant
fact that this personage held the post of master-artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to Queen Tiy; and it is possible that in
him and his patron we have the originators
of the movement. The king, however, was
now old enough to take an active interest
in such matters; and the other artist who
is known by name, a certain Bek, definitely
states that the king himself taught him.
Thus there is reason to suppose that the
young Pharaoh’s own hand is to be traced
in the new canons, although they were instituted
when he was but fifteen years old.</p>


<h3>8. THE NEW RELIGION DEVELOPS.</h3>

<p>There is an interesting record, apparently dating
from about this period, which is to be seen
upon the rocks near the breccia quarries of
Wady Hammamât. Here there are three cartouches
standing upon two <em>neb</em> signs, symbolic
of sovereignty, and above them is the disk and
rays of the new religion. One of these cartouches,
surmounted by the tall feathers worn
by the queens of this period, contains a very
short name, which can only be that of Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Tiy.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The other two cartouches contain the
names Amonhotep (IV.) and the Pharaoh’s second
designation. Thus we see that after the new
religious symbol had been introduced, and just
before the king took the name of “Akhnaton,”
Queen Tiy still held equal royal rank with him,
and was evidently Regent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_076_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>The Artist Auta.</em></div>
</div>

<p>During the fifteenth to the seventeenth years
of his age the king devoted a considerable
amount of time and thought to the changes
which were taking place. With the enthusiasm
of youth he threw himself into the new movement,
and one may suppose that it required
all Queen Tiy’s tact and diplomacy to keep him
from offending his country by some rash action
against the priesthood of Amon. Those priests
were by no means reconciled to the king’s devotion
to Ra-Horakhti; and although he still
nominally served the Theban god, they felt that
every day he was becoming more estranged from
that deity. No doubt there were many passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of arms between the High Priest of Amon-Ra
and this royal High Priest of the sun,
young as he was. The new art, upsetting all
the old religious conventions, was distasteful
to the priests; the new religious thought did
not conform to their stereotyped doctrines; and
much that the king said was absolutely heretical
to their ears. The tide of new thought, directed
in so eager and boyishly unreserved a manner,
was sweeping them from their feet, and they
knew not whither they were being carried.</p>

<p>The court officials blindly followed their young
king, and to every word which he spoke they
listened attentively. Sometimes the thoughts
which he voiced came direct from the mazes of
his own mind; sometimes perhaps he repeated
the utterances of his deep-thinking mother;
and sometimes there passed from his lips the
pearls of wisdom which he had gleaned from
the wise men of his court. It had been the
boy’s desire to listen to the dreams of the
East, to receive into his brain those speculations
which ever meander so charmedly through
the lands more near the sunrise. At his behest
the dreamers of Asia related to him their visions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the philosophers made pregnant his mind with
the mystery of knowledge; the poets sung to
him harp-songs in which echoed the cry of the
elder days; the priests of strange gods submitted
to him the creeds of strange people.
To him was made known the sweetness of the
legends of Greece. The laughter of the woods
rang in his ears, though never in narrow
Egypt had he felt the enchantment of great
forests. He had not seen the mountains, and
the wooded slopes which rise from the Mediterranean
were scenes but dreamed of; and yet
it was the flute of Pan and the song of the
nymphs in the mountain streams which set the
thoughts dancing within his misshapen skull.
He had not walked in the shadow of the cedars
of Lebanon, nor had he ascended the Syrian
hills; but nevertheless the hymns of Adonis and
the chants of Baal were as familiar to him as
were the solemn chants of Amon-Ra. The rose-gardens
of Persia, the incense-groves of Araby,
added their philosophies to his dreams, and the
haunting lips of Babylon whispered to him
tales of far-off days. From Sardinia, Sicily,
Crete, and Cyprus there came to him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
doctrines of those who had business in great
waters; and Libya and Ethiopia disclosed their
mysteries to his eager ears. The fertile brain
of the Pharaoh was thus sown at an early
age with the seed of all that was wonderful in
the world of thought.</p>

<p>It must always be remembered that the king
had much foreign blood in his veins. On the
other hand, those men to whom he spoke, though
highly educated, were but superstitious Egyptians
who could not relieve themselves of the belief
that a divine power rested upon the Pharaoh.
Thus his speculative young brain poured its
fantasies into attentive minds unbiassed by rival
speculations, though narrowed by conventions.
Egyptians, ever lacking in originality, have
always possessed the power to imitate and
adapt; and those nobles whose fortunes were
dependent upon the royal favour soon learnt to
attune their minds to the note of their king.
Daily they must have gone about their business,
ostentatiously attempting to hold to the difficult
path of truth; laboriously telling themselves
what wonders the new thought revealed to them;
loudly praising the wisdom of the boy-Pharaoh;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and nervously asking themselves whether and
when the wrath of Amon would smite them.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the king and his mother
developed their speculations, and drew into their
circle of followers some of the greatest nobles of
the land. A striking example of this proselytising
is to be found in the tomb of the Vizir
Rames. It has already been stated that that
official had constructed for himself a sepulchre
in the Theban necropolis, upon the walls of which
he had first caused a portrait of the young king
to be sculptured in the old conventional style,
and later had added another portrait of the
Pharaoh standing beneath the radiating beams
of the sun, executed in the new style. Rames
now added various other scenes and inscriptions,
and he records a certain speech made by the king
to him, and his own reply.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The words of Ra,” the king had said, “are
before thee.... My august father<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> taught me
their essence and [revealed] them to me.... They
were known in my heart, opened to my face. I
understood....”</p>

<p>“Thou art the Only One of Aton; in possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of his designs,” replied Rames. “Thou hast directed
the mountains. The fear of thee is in the midst of
their secret chambers, as it is in the hearts of the
people. The mountains hearken to thee as the
people hearken.”</p></div>

<p>Thus one sees how the king was already formulating
some kind of doctrine in his head, and that
the nobles were receiving it; but it is significant
that there are here representations of Rames
loaded with gifts by the Pharaoh, as though in
reward for his allegiance. The Pharaoh seems,
indeed, to have showered honours upon those
who appeared to grasp intelligently the thoughts
which were still immature in his own head; and
there must have been many an antagonist who
rallied to his standard from the sheer love of
gold. The king was in need of all the support
which he could muster, for an open break with
the priesthood of Amon-Ra grew more and more
probable as his doctrines shaped themselves in
his mind; and although the people of Egypt as
a whole would, without question, follow their
Pharaoh for the one reason that he <em>was</em> Pharaoh,
there was every probability that the Amon priesthood
and the Theban populace would make something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of a stand against any infringement of the
rights of their local god.</p>

<p>The young Pharaoh seems to have been very
popular, and one may presume that he inherited,
from his illustrious fathers, the charm of manner
which there is not a little evidence to show
they possessed. Throughout his life, and for
some years after his death, he retained the
affection of his people; and when one considers
how faithfully his nobles followed him so long
as he had strength and health to lead them,
and how completely lost they were at his death,
one realises how great an influence he must have
exerted over them. Even at this early age they
seem to have possessed a deep regard for the
grave, thoughtful boy; and behind all the pretence,
the hypocrisy, and the merely conventional
loyalty, one surely catches a glimpse of a
strong, personal affection for the king.</p>

<p>We must here record the birth of the king’s
first daughter, which occurred in about the fifth
year of his reign, when he was some sixteen years
of age, and when Nefertiti was about thirteen
years old. The child was named Merytaton,
“Beloved of Aton”; and though the advent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
a daughter instead of a son must have been a
grave disappointment to the royal couple, a remarkable
degree of affection was lavished upon
the little girl, as will be apparent in the sequel.</p>


<h3>9. THE NATURE OF THE NEW RELIGION.</h3>

<p>There was nothing strikingly exalted in the
religion which was now so filling the king’s mind.
Ra-Horakhti Aton was in no wise considered as
the only god: there were as yet no ideas of
monotheism in the doctrine. In the new temple
at Karnak, as we have seen, Horus, Set, Wepwat,
and other gods were named; and elsewhere
Amon was reluctantly recognised. The goddess
Maat, in the tomb of Rames, was not obliterated
from the walls, but still stood protecting the king;
and in the same tomb Horus of Edfu is invoked.
In the tomb of Horemheb, Horus, Osiris, Isis,
Nephthys, and Hathor are mentioned, and the
gods of the Necropolis still receive honour;
Horemheb himself still holds the honorary post
of High Priest of Horus, Lord of Alabastronpolis;
Thoth and Maat are referred to; and there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
a magical prayer to Ra, which is by no means
of lofty character. Scarabs of this period speak
of the Pharaoh as beloved of Thoth. And in
a letter to the king dated in the fifth year of
his reign, Ptah and “the gods and goddesses”
of Memphis are referred to.</p>

<p>This letter is of such interest that a fuller
account of it must here be given. It was
addressed to the king, who is still called Amonhotep,
by a royal steward named Apiy, who
lived at Memphis. Two copies of the letter
were found at Gurob,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> both dated in the fifth
year of the king’s reign, the third month of
winter, and the nineteenth day. The letter
begins with the full titles of the Pharaoh, including
the phrase “living in truth,” which
from this time onwards was always added to
his name. Then follows the invocation: “May
Ptah of the beautiful countenance work for
thee, who created thy beauties, thy true father
who raised (?) thee from his house to rule the
orbit of the Aton.” Next comes the real business
of the letter: “A communication is this
to the Master, [to whom be] life, prosperity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
health, to give information that the temple of
thy father Ptah ... is sound and prosperous;
the house of Pharaoh ... is flourishing; the
establishments of Pharaoh ... are flourishing;
the residence of Pharaoh ... is flourishing and
healthy; the offerings of all the gods and goddesses
who are upon the soil (?) of Memphis are
... complete; complete [are they] there is nothing
delayed from them.” Again the titles of the king
are given, and the letter ends with the date.</p>

<p>Thus in the fifth year of the king’s reign,
when he was about sixteen years of age, the
various gods of Egypt were still acknowledged;
and, though the art had been changed and the
worship of Ra-Horakhti under the name of Aton
had made great strides towards supremacy, there
is as yet no sign of the lofty monotheism which
the Pharaoh was soon to propound.</p>

<p>In the portions of the tomb of Horemheb which
date from this period, Ra-Horakhti is invoked
in the following words: “Ra-Horakhti, great
god, Lord of heaven, Lord of earth, who cometh
forth from his horizon and illuminateth the
Two Lands [of Egypt], the sun of darkness
as the great one, as Ra;” and again: “Ra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Lord of Truth, great god, sovereign of Heliopolis,
... Horakhti, only god, king of the gods, who
rises in the west and sendeth forth his beauty.”
From other sources, which we have seen, the
god is called “Ra-Horakhti rejoicing in the
horizon in his name Heat-which-is-in-Aton.”</p>

<p>Here we have simply the old religion of
Heliopolis, to which has been grafted something
of the doctrines of the Syrian Adonis
or Aton. At Heliopolis there was a sacred
bull, known as Mnevis, which was regarded as the
living personification of Ra-Horakhti, and which
was treated with divine honours, like the more
famous Apis bull of Memphis. Even this superstition
was accepted by the king at this time,
and continued to be acknowledged by him for
yet another year or two.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The “Heat-which-is-in-Aton”
offered food for much speculation, and,
by directing the attention to an intangible quality
of the sun, opened up the widest fields for religious
thought. But, with this exception, there was
nothing as yet in the new religion to command
one’s admiration.</p>

<hr class="r20" />

<h3>1. THE BREAK WITH THE PRIESTHOOD
OF AMON-RA.</h3>


<p class="noindent">The expected break with the priesthood of
Amon was not long in coming. One knows
nothing of the details of the quarrel, but it
may be supposed that Akhnaton himself flung
down the gauntlet, making the rash attempt
to rid himself of the weight of an organisation
which had proved such a drag upon his actions.
There is no evidence to show that he disbanded
the priesthood, or prohibited the worship
of Amon at this period of his reign; but as
the ultimate persecution of that god, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
years later, commenced very soon after the
death of his mother, one may suppose that
it was her restraining influence which prevented
him from precipitating a struggle to the death
with the god of Thebes. The king was now
entering upon the sixth year of his reign and
the seventeenth of his age, and he was already
developing in his mind theories and principles
which were soon to produce radical changes in
the new religion of the Court. He found, no
doubt, that it was hopeless to attempt to
convert the people of Thebes to the new
doctrines; and daily he realised the more
clearly that the development either of the
faith of Ra-Horakhti Aton, or of the ideals
which he was beginning to find therein,
was cramped and checked by the hostility
of the influences which pressed around his
immediate circle. From the walls of every
temple, from pylons and gateways, pillars and
obelisks, the figure of Amon stared down at
him in defiance; and everywhere he was confronted
with the tokens of that god’s power.
His little temple at Karnak was overshadowed
by the larger buildings of Amon; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
few priests who served at the new altar were
lost amidst the crowds of the ministers of the
Theban god. How could the flower thrive
and bloom in such uncongenial soil? How could
the sun shine through such density of conventional
tradition?</p>

<p>The king, no doubt, endeavoured to cripple
the priesthood of Amon by cutting down its
budget as much as possible, and by attempting
to win over to his side some of the
priests of high standing. Had he succeeded in
reducing it to the rank of the smaller cults,
it is probable that he would have been satisfied
so to leave it; for at this time he wished
only to place Ra-Horakhti in a position of
undoubted supremacy above all other gods.
But the vast resources of Amon seemed unconquerable,
and there appeared to be little
chance of reducing the priesthood to a position
of inferior rank.</p>

<p>In this dilemma the king took a step
which had been for some time considered
in his mind and in the minds of his advisers.
He decided to abandon Thebes. He would
build a city far away from all contaminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
influences, and there he would hold his court
and worship his god. On clean, new soil, he
would establish the earthly home of Ra-Horakhti
Aton, and there, with his faithful
followers, he would develop those schemes
which now so filled his brain. Thus also,
by reducing Thebes to the position of a provincial
town, he might lessen the power of
the priesthood of Amon; for no longer would
Amon be the royal god, the god of the capital.
He would shake the dust of Thebes from
off his sandals, and never again would he
allow himself to be baffled and irritated by
the sight of the glories of Amon.</p>

<p>The first step which he took was that of
changing his name from Amonhotep, “The-Peace-of-Amon,”
to Akhnaton, “The-Glory-of-Aton”;
and from that time forth the word
Amon hardly passed his lips. He retained
two of his other names,&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, “Beautiful-is-the-Being-of-Ra,”
and “The-Only-One-of-Ra,” the
latter being often used by him; but such titles
and names as that which made mention of
Karnak be entirely dispensed with. He now
laid more stress upon the nature of his god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
as “Aton” or “the Aton”<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> than as Ra-Horakhti;
and from this time onwards the name
Ra-Horakhti becomes less and less prominent,
though retained throughout the king’s reign.</p>


<h3>2. AKHNATON SELECTS THE SITE OF HIS CITY.</h3>

<p>Down the river it would seem that the young
Pharaoh now sailed in his royal <em>dahabiyeh</em>, looking
to right and left as he went, now inspecting
this site and now examining that. At last he
came upon a place which suited his fancy to perfection.
It was situated about 160 miles above the
modern Cairo. At this point the limestone cliffs
upon the east bank leave the river and recede for
about three miles, returning to the water some
five or six miles farther along. Thus a bay is
formed which is protected on its west side by
the river in which there here lies a small island,
and in all other directions by the crescent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
cliffs. Upon the island he would erect pavilions
and pleasure-houses. Along the edge of the river
there was a narrow strip of cultivated land whereon
he would plant his palace gardens, and those
of the nobles’ villas. Behind this verdant band
the smooth desert stretched, and here he would
build the palace itself and the great temples.
Behind this again, the sand and gravel surface
of the wilderness gently sloped up to the foot
of the cliffs, and here there would be roads and
causeways whereon the chariots might be whirled
in the early mornings. In the face of the cliffs
he would cut his tomb and those of his followers;
and at intervals around the crescent of these
hills he would cause great boundary-stones to
be made, so that all men might know and
respect the limits of his city. What splendid
quays would edge the river, what palaces reflect
their whiteness in its waters! There would be
broad shaded avenues, and shimmering lakes surrounded
by the fairest trees of Asia. Temples
would raise their lofty pylons to the blue skies,
and broad courts should lie stretched in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>In Akhnaton’s youthful mind there already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
stood the temples and the mansions; already he
heard the sound of sweet music. The laughter
of maidens was added to the singing of the
birds which he heard in the trees; the pomp
of imperial Egypt displaced the farm-houses and
the fields of corn which now occupied the site;
and the song of the shepherd in the wilderness
was changed to the rolling psalms of the Aton.
Fair was this dream and enthralling to the
dreamer. To Queen Tiy it probably did not
appeal so strongly; for Thebes was full of
associations to her, and her palace beside the
lake was very dear. There is, indeed, every
reason to suppose that the dowager-queen lived
on at Thebes after her son had abandoned it.</p>


<h3>3. THE FIRST FOUNDATION INSCRIPTION.</h3>

<p>Preparations were soon made for the laying
out of the city, and in a very short time
Akhnaton was called upon to visit the site in
order to perform the foundation ceremonies.
Fortunately the inscriptions upon some of the
boundary tablets in the desert tell us something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the manner in which the king marked the
limits of the city.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The first inscription reads
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Year 6, fourth month of the second season,
day 13.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> ... On this day the King was in
the City of the Horizon of Aton.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> His Majesty
ascended a great chariot of electrum, [appearing]
like Aton when he rises from his [eastern]
horizon and fills the land with his love; and
he started a goodly course [from his camping
place] to the City of the Horizon.... Heaven
was joyful, earth was glad, and every heart was
happy when they saw him. And his Majesty
offered a great sacrifice to Aton, of bread, beer,
horned bulls, polled bulls, beasts, fowl, wine,
incense, frankincense, and all goodly herbs on
this day of demarcating the City of the
Horizon....</p>

<p>After these things, the good pleasure of Aton
being done, ... [the King returned from] the
City of the Horizon, and he rested upon his great
throne with which he is well pleased, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
uplifts his beauties. And his Majesty continued
in the presence of his father Aton, and Aton
shone upon him in life and length of days,
invigorating his body each day.</p>

<p>And his Majesty said, “Bring me the companions
of the King, the great ones and the
mighty ones, the captains of soldiers, and the
nobles of the land in its entirety.” And they
were conducted to him straightway, and they
lay on their bellies before his Majesty, kissing
the ground before his mighty will.</p>

<p>And his Majesty said unto them, “Ye behold
the City of the Horizon of Aton, which the
Aton has desired me to make for him as a
monument in the great name of my Majesty
for ever. For it was the Aton, my father,
that brought me to this City of the Horizon.
There was not a noble who directed me to it;
there was not any man in the whole land
who led me to it, saying, ‘It is fitting for his
Majesty that he make a City of the Horizon
of Aton in this place.’ Nay, but it was the
Aton, my father, that directed me to it to
make it for him.... Behold the Pharaoh found
that [this site] belonged not to a god, nor to
a goddess, it belonged not to a prince, nor to
a princess. There was no right for any man
to act as owner of it.” ...</p>

<p>[... And they answered and said] “Lo!
it is Aton that putteth [the thought] in thy
heart regarding any place that he desires. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
doth not uplift the name of any King except
thy Majesty; he doth not [exalt] any other
except [thee.] ... Thou drawest unto Aton
every land, thou adornest for him the towns which
he had made for his own self, all lands, all
countries, the Hanebu<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> with their products and
their tribute upon their backs for him that made
their life, and by whose rays one lives and
breathes the air. May he grant eternity in
seeing his rays.... Verily, the City of the
Horizon will thrive like Aton in heaven for ever
and ever.”</p>

<p>Then his Majesty lifted his hand to heaven
unto Him that formed him, saying, “As my
father Ra-Horakhti Aton liveth, the great and
living Aton, ordaining life, vigorous in life, my
father, my rampart of a million cubits, my remembrancer
of eternity, my witness of that
which pertains to eternity, who formeth himself
with his own hands, whom no artificer hath
known, who is established in rising and in setting
each day without ceasing. Whether he is
in heaven or in earth,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> every eye seeth him
without [failing,] while he fills the land with
his beams and makes every face to live. With
seeing whom may my eyes be satisfied daily,
when he rises in this temple of Aton in the
City of the Horizon, and fills it with his own
self by his beams, beauteous in love, and lays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
them upon me in life and length of days for
ever and ever.</p>

<p>“I will make the City of the Horizon of
Aton for the Aton, my father, in this place. I
will not make the City south of it, north of it,
west of it, or east of it. I will not pass beyond
the southern boundary-stone southward, neither
will I pass beyond the northern boundary-stone
northward to make for him a City of the Horizon
there; neither will I make for him a city on
the western side. Nay, but I will make the
City of the Horizon for the Aton, my father,
upon the east side, the place which he did
enclose for his own self with cliffs, and made
a plain (?) in the midst of it that I might sacrifice
to him thereon: this is it. Neither shall
the Queen say unto me, ‘Behold, there is a
goodly place for the City of the Horizon in
another place,’ and I hearken unto her. Neither
shall any noble nor [any one] of all men who
are in the whole land [say unto me], ‘Behold,
there is a goodly place for the City of the
Horizon in another place,’ and I hearken unto
them. Whether it be down-stream or southwards,
or westwards, or eastwards, I will not say ‘I
will abandon this City of the Horizon and will
hasten away and make the City of the Horizon
in this other goodly place’ for ever. Nay,
but I did find this City of the Horizon for
the Aton, which he had himself desired, and
with which he is pleased for ever and ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will make a temple of Aton for the
Aton, my father, in this place. I will make
a ... of Aton for the Aton, my father, in
this place. I will make a Shadow-of-the-Sun<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
of the Great Wife of the King, Nefertiti, for
the Aton, my father, in this place. I will
make a House of Rejoicing for the Aton, my
father, on the island of ‘Aton illustrious in
Festivals’ in this place.... I will make all
works which are necessary for the Aton, my
father, in this place. I will make ... for the
Aton, my father, in this place. I will make
for myself the Palace of Pharaoh; and I will
make the Palace of the Queen in this place.
There shall be made for me a sepulchre in the
eastern hills; my burial shall be made therein ...
and the burial of the Chief Wife of the King, Nefertiti,
shall be made therein, and the burial of the
King’s daughter Merytaton shall be made therein.
If I die in any town of the north, south, west,
or east, I will be brought here and my burial shall
be made in the City of the Horizon. If the Great
Queen, Nefertiti, who lives, die in any town of the
north, south, west, or east, she shall be brought here
and buried in the City of the Horizon. If the
King’s daughter Merytaton die in any town of
the north, south, west, or east, she shall be brought
here and buried in the City of the Horizon. And
the sepulchre of Mnevis shall be made in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
eastern hills and he shall be buried therein. The
tombs of the High Priests and the Divine Fathers
and the priests of the Aton shall be made in
the eastern hills, and they shall be buried therein.
The tombs of the officers, and others, shall be
made in the eastern hills, and they shall be
buried therein.</p>

<p>“For as my father Ra-Horakhti Aton liveth ...
[the words?] of the priests, more evil are they
than those things which I heard until the year
four, more evil are they than those things which
I have heard in ... more evil are they than
those things which King [Nebmaara<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>] heard,
more evil are they than those things which
Menkheperura<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> heard....”</p>
</div>

<p>The rest of the inscription is so much broken
that only a few words here and there can be
read. They seem to refer to the king’s further
projects,&mdash;how he will make ships to sail to and
from the city, how he will build granaries, celebrate
festivals, plant trees, and so on.</p>

<p>The reference to the year four is very interesting,
and it would seem that it was at about
that date that the king’s eyes were opened to
the necessity of making war upon the priesthood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of Amon. As we have seen, it was in about
the fourth year of his reign that the great
changes in the art took place, and the symbol
of the sun’s rays was introduced into the
sculptures. The mention of the two previous
Pharaohs shows that troubles were already
brewing then; but it had remained for the
energetic young Akhnaton to bring matters to
a head.</p>


<h3>4. THE SECOND FOUNDATION INSCRIPTION.</h3>

<p>The inscription recording these events was
probably not written until some months after
they had occurred. Just when the engravers
had made an end of their work a second daughter
was born to the king and queen, whom they
named Meketaton; and orders were given that
her figure should be added upon the boundary
tablet beside that of her sister, which already appeared
there with Akhnaton and Nefertiti. The
king was somewhat distressed that a son had
not been granted to him; for the thought was
bitter that, in the event of his death, all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
projects would fall to the ground. He therefore
altered the wording of the inscriptions about
to be written on the other boundary tablets; and,
by including his oath in the text, he added an
even greater integrity to the decree. The name
of the second daughter was now inserted in this
inscription, which reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Year six, fourth month of the second season,
thirteenth day.</p>

<p>On this day the King was in the City of the
Horizon of Aton, in the parti-coloured tent made
for his Majesty in the City of the Horizon, the
name of which is “The Aton is well pleased.”
And his Majesty ascended a great chariot of electrum,
drawn by a span of horses, and [he appeared]
like Aton when he rises from the horizon and fills
the two lands with his love. And he started a
goodly course to the City of the Horizon, on this the
first occasion, ... to dedicate it as a monument
to the Aton, even as his father Ra-Horakhti Aton
had given command.... And he caused a great
sacrifice to be offered.</p>

<p>And his Majesty went southward, and halted
on his chariot before his father Ra-Horakhti Aton,
at the [foot of the] south-east hills, and Aton shone
upon him in life and length of days, invigorating
his body every day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Now this is the oath pronounced by the King:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As my father Ra-Horakhti Aton liveth, as
my heart is happy in the Queen and her children&mdash;as
to whom may it be granted that the Chief Wife
of the King, Nefertiti, living for ever and ever, grow
aged after a multitude of years, in the care of the
Pharaoh, and may it be granted that the King’s
daughter Merytaton and the King’s daughter
Meketaton, her children, grow old in the care of
the Chief Wife of the King, their mother....</p>

<p>“This is my oath of truth which it is my desire
to pronounce, and of which I will not say ‘It is
false’ eternally for ever.</p>

<p>“The southern boundary-stone which is on the
eastern hills. It is the boundary-stone of the City
of the Horizon, namely this one by which I have
made halt. I will not pass beyond it southwards
for ever and ever. Make the south-west boundary-stone
opposite it on the western hills of the City
of the Horizon exactly.</p>

<p>“The middle boundary-stone which is on the
eastern hills. It is the boundary-stone of the City
of the Horizon by which I have made halt on the
eastern hills of the City of the Horizon. I will
not pass beyond it eastwards for ever and ever.
Make the middle boundary-stone which is to be
on the western hills opposite it exactly.</p>

<p>“The north-eastern boundary-stone by which I
have made halt. It is the northern boundary-stone
of the City of the Horizon. I will not pass beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
it down-stream for ever and ever. Make the north
boundary-stone which is to be on the western hills
opposite it exactly.</p>

<p>“And the City of the Horizon of Aton extends
from the south boundary-stone as far as the north
boundary-stone, measured between boundary-stone
and boundary-stone on the eastern, hills [which
measurement] amounts to 6 <em>ater</em>,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> ¾ <em>khe</em>, and 4
cubits. Likewise from the south-west boundary-stone
to the north-west boundary-stone on the
western hills [the measurement] amounts to 6 <em>ater</em>,
¾ <em>khe</em>, and 4 cubits likewise exactly.</p>

<p>“And the area within these four boundary-stones
from the eastern hills to the western hills is the
City of the Horizon of Aton in its proper self.
It belongs to my father Ra-Horakhti Aton: mountains,
deserts, meadows, islands, high-ground, low-ground,
land, water, villages, embankments, men,
beasts, groves, and all things which the Aton my
father shall bring into existence for ever and ever.</p>

<p>“I will not neglect this oath which I have
made to the Aton my father for ever and ever;
nay, but it shall be set on a tablet of stone as
the south-east boundary, likewise as the north-east
boundary of the City of the Horizon; and it
shall be set likewise on a tablet of stone as the
south-west boundary, likewise as the north-west
boundary of the City of the Horizon. It shall
not be erased, it shall not be washed out, it shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not be kicked, it shall not be struck with stones,
its spoiling shall not be brought about. If it be
missing, if it be spoilt, if the tablet on which it
is shall fall, I will renew it again afresh in the
place in which it was.”</p></div>


<h3>5. THE DEPARTURE FROM THEBES.</h3>

<p>From the above inscription one sees that
Akhnaton had now decided to include the
west bank of the river, opposite to the original
site, in the new domain; and the great
boundary tablets are there to be found as on
the eastern side. By the time these decrees
were engraved the Pharaoh was nearly eighteen
years of age; and these developments in
his plans are the natural signs of the progress
of his brain towards that of a grown man.</p>

<p>Having laid the foundations of the city, the
king probably returned to Thebes, where he
waited as patiently as possible for his dream
to take concrete form. This period of waiting
must have been peculiarly trying to him, for
his troubles with the Amon priesthood must
have embittered his days. He seems, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to have been extremely devoted to his wife,
Nefertiti, who had now grown, it would seem,
into a beautiful young woman of fifteen or
sixteen years of age; and the arrival of the
second baby afforded an interest which meant
much to him. One may now picture the king
and queen living, in the seclusion of the palace,
a homely, simple existence, ever dwelling in
a happy day-dream upon the future glories of
the new city, and the rising power of the
religion of Aton. Akhnaton’s ill-health, of
course, must have caused both his friends
and himself much anxiety; but even this had
its compensations, for those who suffer from
epilepsy are by the gods beloved, and Akhnaton,
no doubt, believed the hallucinations due to
his disease to be god-given visions. There
must have been a very considerable amount
of business to be worked through in connection
with the building of the city, and he
could have had little time to brood upon what
he now considered to be the wrongs inflicted
upon him and his house by the priests of
Amon.</p>

<p>So passed the seventh year of his reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
without any particular records to mark it.
At Aswan there is a monument which perhaps
dates from about this period. The king’s
chief sculptor, Bek, was there employed in
obtaining red granite for the decoration of
the new city; and he caused to be made
upon a large rock a commemorative tablet.
On it one sees him before Akhnaton, whose
figure has been erased at a later date; and
the altar of the Aton, above which are the
usual sun’s rays, stands beside them. Bek calls
himself “The Chief of the Works in the Red
[Granite] Hills, the assistant whom his Majesty
himself taught, Chief of the Sculptors on
the great and mighty monuments of the
King in the house of Aton in the City of
the Horizon of Aton.” Here also one sees
Men, the father of Bek, who was also Chief
of the Sculptors, presenting an offering to a
statue of Amonhotep III., under whom he had
served.</p>

<p>The eighth year of Akhnaton’s reign, and the
nineteenth year of his age, was memorable, for
it would seem that he now took up his permanent
residence in the City of the Horizon. On some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of the boundary tablets a repetition of the royal
oath is recorded; and, as this is the last mention
of <em>a visit</em> made by Akhnaton to the new capital,
one may suppose that henceforth he was resident
there. The inscription reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This oath (of the sixth year) was repeated in year
eight, first month of the second season, eighth day.
The King was in the City of the Horizon of Aton,
and Pharaoh stood mounted on a great chariot of
electrum, inspecting the boundary-stones of the
Aton....</p></div>

<p>Then follows a list of these boundary-stones,
and the inscription ends with the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And the breadth of the City of the Horizon of
Aton is from cliff to cliff, from the eastern horizon
of heaven to the western horizon of heaven. It
shall be for my father Ra-Horakhti Aton, its hills,
its deserts, all its fowl, all its people, all its cattle,
all things which the Aton produces, on which his
rays shine, all things which are in ... the City of
the Horizon, they shall be for the father, the living
Aton, unto the temple of Aton in the City of the
Horizon for ever and ever; they are all offered to
his spirit. And may his rays be beauteous when
they receive them.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_108_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Akhnaton and Nefertiti with their three Daughters.</em></div>
</div>

<p>Thus was the king’s city planned and laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
out. The two years of feverish work had
probably produced considerable results, and
already we may picture the city taking form.
The royal palace was perhaps almost finished
by now, and the villas of some of the nobles
were habitable. With many a sigh of relief
Akhnaton must have bade farewell to Thebes. A
third daughter, who was named Ankhsenpaaton,
had just been born; and one may thus picture
the royal party which sailed down the river
as being very distinctly a family. One sees
Akhnaton, a sickly young man of nineteen years
of age, walking to and fro upon the deck of the
royal vessel, with his hand upon the shoulder
of his fair young wife, now some seventeen years
old, in whose arms the baby princess is carried.
Toddling beside them are the two other princesses,
one somewhat over two years of age, the other
about four years. The queen’s sister, Nezemmut,
records of whose existence soon become apparent,
was perhaps also of the party, having left the
court of Mitanni to be a companion to Nefertiti.
Ay and Ty, the foster-parents of Nefertiti, were
doubtless with the royal family now as they
sailed down the river; and several of the nobles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
who play a part in the following pages no doubt
formed the suite which attended to the royal
commands.</p>


<h3>6. THE AGE OF AKHNATON.</h3>

<p>We have spoken of the king as being nineteen
years old. The story has now reached a point
at which we must pause to consider this vexed
question of Akhnaton’s age. In the above
pages it has been said that the Pharaoh was
about eleven years old at his marriage and
accession to the throne; was fifteen when the
canons of art were changed and the symbols of
the Aton religion introduced; was seventeen
when the foundations of the new city were laid;
and was nineteen when he took up his residence
there. Let us study these ages in the above
order.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_110_fp.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>The Head of the Mummy of Thothmes IV., the grandfather of
Akhnaton.</em></div>
</div>

<p>Firstly, then, as to the king’s marriage. The
mummy of Thothmes IV., the grandfather of
Akhnaton, has been shown by Dr Elliot Smith
to be that of a man not more than about twenty-six
years of age. That king was succeeded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
his son Amonhotep III., who is known to have
been married to Queen Tiy before the second
year of his reign, and to have been old enough
at that time to begin to hunt big game. It
would be difficult to believe that he would be
permitted to join any hunting party, however
secure against accident, before the twelfth year
of his age; but, on the other hand, if he was
more than that age, his father would have to
have been less than twelve at <em>his</em> marriage.
Thus the only possible conclusion is that both
Thothmes IV. and Amonhotep III. were barely
thirteen when they were married, and very
possibly even younger. This is shown to be a
correct conclusion by the fact that the mummy
of Amonhotep III. has been pronounced by Dr
Elliot Smith to be that of a man of forty-five or
fifty; and as he reigned thirty-six years he must
have been <em>at most</em> fourteen, and probably some
years younger, at his accession and marriage.</p>

<p>There is not sufficient evidence to show at
what ages the previous Pharaohs of the dynasty
had married, but as Akhnaton’s father and
grandfather entered into matrimony at this
early age, it would not be safe to suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that he himself delayed his marriage till a
later age. Queen Tiy was in all probability
married when she was ten or eleven years old.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Akhnaton’s daughter Merytaton, who was born
in the fourth or fifth year of his reign, was, as
will be seen in due course, married before the
seventeenth year of the reign&mdash;that is to say,
when she was twelve or younger. The Princess
Ankhsenpaaton, who was born in the eighth
year, was married, at latest, two years after
Akhnaton’s death&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, when she was eleven.
Another of Akhnaton’s daughters, Nefernefernaton,
who has not yet appeared, was born
in her father’s eleventh year and was married
before the fifteenth, and therefore could only
have been four or five years of age.</p>

<p>Child-marriages such as these are common
in Egypt, even at the present day. Those
who have lived on the Nile, and have studied
the national habits, will assuredly fix the probable
age of a royal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mariage de convenance</i> at
about thirteen years, and will agree that eleven
and twelve are also highly likely ages.</p>

<p>Secondly, as to Akhnaton’s age at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
changing of the art. In the biography of
Bakenkhonsu, the High Priest of Amon under
Rameses II., that official tells us that he arrived
at the state of manhood at the age of sixteen,
and one may therefore suppose that this was
the recognised legal age at which a man became
a responsible agent in Egypt. Now it has
been clearly seen that Akhnaton was under the
regency of his mother during the first years
of his reign, and mention has been made of
the inscription at Wady Hammamât, where,
although the new symbol of the religion is
shown, Queen Tiy’s name is placed beside that
of her son in an equally honourable position.
She was thus still Queen Regent when the art
was changed, and her son could not yet have
come of age&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, he must then have been under
sixteen.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we have to consider the question
of his age when he laid the foundations of the
new city. This was the first decisive action
performed by the king in which his mother
has no concern, and of which she perhaps even
disapproved, and it surely marks the period
at which he took the government into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
own hands. If, like Bakenkhonsu, he came of
age at sixteen, in the fifth year of his reign, the
founding of the new capital in the following
year would well fit in with the supposition
that the abandoning of Thebes marks the date
of the king’s arrival at maturity.</p>

<p>It may be asked how so young a person
could conceive that great dream of the new
city dedicated to the Aton. But, after all, he
was seventeen years of age when the idea
came to him, nineteen when he had properly
developed the plan, and perhaps as much as
twenty when he took up his residence there.
Akhnaton’s greatness, as will be seen later,
dates from the height of his reign in the City
of the Horizon, and not from his early years.
Still, when one calls to mind the infant prodigies,
the child preachers who stir an audience
at the age of twelve, one may credit a boy of
sixteen or seventeen with the planning of a new
city. Even in the cold Occident such youthful
wiseacres are not rare, and surely they
blossom forth less infrequently in the maturing
warmth of the Orient.</p>

AKHNATON FORMULATES THE
RELIGION OF ATON.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“No such grand theology had ever appeared in the world before, so far
as we know; and it is the forerunner of the later monotheist religions.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Petrie</span>:
‘The Religion of Ancient Egypt.’</p></div>

<hr class="r20" />

<h3>1. ATON THE TRUE GOD.</h3>


<p class="noindent">Amidst the fair palaces and verdant gardens
of the new city, Akhnaton, now a man of some
twenty years, turned his thoughts fully to the
development of his religion. It is necessary,
therefore, for us to glance at the essential
features of this the most enlightened doctrine
of the ancient world, and in some degree to
make ourselves acquainted with the creed which
the king himself was evolving out of that worship
of Ra-Horakhti Aton in which he had
been educated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Originally the Aton was the actual sun’s disk;
but, as has been said, the god was now called
“Heat-which-is-in-Aton,” and Akhnaton, concentrating
his attention on this aspect of the
godhead, drew the eyes of his followers towards
a force far more intangible and distant than
the dazzling orb to which they bowed down.
Akhnaton’s conception of God, as we now begin
to observe it, was as the power which created
the sun, the energy which penetrated to this
earth in the sun’s heat and caused all things
to grow. At the present day the scientist will
tell you that God is the ultimate source of life,
that where natural explanation fails there God
is to be found: He is, in a word, the author
of energy, the primal motive-power of all known
things. Akhnaton, centuries upon centuries before
the birth of the scientist, defined God in
just this manner. In an age when men believed,
as some do still, that a deity was but an exaggerated
creature of this earth, having a form
built on material lines, this youthful Pharaoh
proclaimed God to be the formless essence,
the intelligent germ, the loving force, which
permeated time and space. Let it be clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
understood that the Aton as conceived by the
young Pharaoh was in no sense one of those
old deities which our God ultimately replaced
in Egypt. The Aton is God as we conceive
Him. There is no quality attributed by the
king to the Aton which we do not attribute
to our God. Like a flash of blinding light in
the night-time the Aton stands out for a
moment amidst the black Egyptian darkness,
and disappears once more,&mdash;the first signal to
this world of the future religion of the West.
No man whose mind is free from prejudice will
fail to see a far closer resemblance to the teachings
of Christ in the religion of Akhnaton than
in that of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The
faith of the patriarchs is the lineal ancestor
of the Christian faith; but the creed of Akhnaton
is its isolated prototype. One might believe
that Almighty God had for a moment revealed
himself to Egypt, and had been more clearly,
though more momentarily, interpreted there than
ever He was in Syria or Palestine before the
time of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>


<h3>2. ATON THE TENDER FATHER OF ALL
CREATION.</h3>

<p>Amon-Ra and the old gods of Egypt were,
for the most part, but deified mortals, endued
with monstrous, though limited, powers, and still
having around them traditions of aggrandised
human deeds. Others, we have seen, had their
origin in natural phenomena: the wind, the Nile,
the starry heavens, and the like. All were
terrific or revengeful, if so they had a mind
to be, and all were able to be moved by human
emotions. But to Akhnaton, although he had
absolutely no precedent upon which to launch
his thoughts, God was the intangible and yet
ever-present Father of mankind, made manifest
in sunshine. The youthful high priest called
upon his subjects to search for their God not
in the confusion of battle or behind the smoke
of human sacrifices, but amidst the flowers and
the trees, amidst the wild duck and the fishes.
He preached an enlightened nature-study: in
some respects he was, perhaps, the first apostle
of the Simple Life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>He strove to break down conventional thought,
and ceaselessly he urged his people to worship
“in truth,” simply, without an excess of ceremonial.
While the elder gods had been apparent
in natural convulsions and in the more
awful incidents of life, Akhnaton’s kindly father
could be seen in the little details of existence,
in the growing poppies, in the soft wind which
filled the sails of the ships, in the fish which
leapt from the river. Like a greater than he,
Akhnaton taught his disciples to address their
maker as their “Father which art in Heaven.”
The Aton was the joy which caused the young
sheep “to dance upon their legs,” and the birds
“to flutter in their marshes.” He was the god
of the simple pleasures of life; and although
Akhnaton himself was indeed a man of sorrows,
plenteously acquainted with grief, happiness was
the watchword which he gave to his followers.</p>

<p>Akhnaton did not permit any graven image to
be made of the Aton. The True God, said the
king, had no form; and he held to this opinion
throughout his life. The symbol of the religion
was the sun’s disk, from which there extended
numerous rays, each ray ending in a hand; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
this symbol was not worshipped. To Christians,
in the same way, the cross is the symbol of
their creed; but the cross itself is not worshipped.
Never before had man conceived a
formless deity, a god who was not endowed
with the five human senses. The Hebrew patriarchs
believed God to be capable of walking
in a garden in the cool of the evening, to have
made man in his own image, to be possessed of
face, form, and hinder parts. But Akhnaton,
stemming with his hand the flood of tradition,
boldly proclaimed God to be a life-giving, intangible
essence: the <em>heat</em> which is in the sun.
He was “the living Aton,”&mdash;that is to say, the
power which produced and sustained the energy
and movement of the sun. Although he was
so often called “the Aton,” he was more closely
defined as “the Master of the Aton.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The
flaming glory of the sun was the most practical
symbol of the godhead, and the warm rays of
sunshine constituted the most obvious connection
between heaven and earth; but always Akhnaton
attempted to raise the eyes of the thinkers beyond
this visible or understandable expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of divinity, to strain them upwards in the effort
to discern that which was “behind the veil.”
In lighting on a motive power more remote
than the sun, and acting through the sun,
the young Pharaoh may be said to have penetrated
as far behind the eternal barrier as one
may ever hope to penetrate this side the churchyard.
But though so remote, the Aton was
the tender, loving Father of all men, ever-present
and ever-mindful of his creatures. There
dropped not a sigh from the lips of a babe
that the intangible Aton did not hear; no lamb
bleated for its mother but the remote Aton
hastened to soothe it. He was the loving
“Father and Mother of all that He had
made,” who “brought up millions by His bounty.”</p>

<p>The destructive qualities of the sun were never
referred to, and that pitiless orb under which
Egypt sweats and groans for the summer months
each year had nothing in common with the gentle
Father conceived by Akhnaton. The Aton was
“the Lord of Love.” He was the tender nurse
who “creates the man-child in woman, and
soothes him that he may not weep”; whose
love, to use an Egyptian phrase of exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
tenderness, “makes the hands to faint.” His
beams were “beauteous with love” as they fell
upon His people and upon His city, “very rich
in love.” “Thy love is great and large,” says
one of Akhnaton’s psalms. “Thou fillest the
two lands of Egypt with Thy love;” and
another passage runs: “Thy rays encompass
the lands.... Thou bindest them with Thy
love.”</p>

<p>Surely never in the history of the world had
man conceived a god who “so loved the world.”
One may search the inscriptions in vain for any
reference to a malignant power, to vengeance,
to jealousy, or to hatred. The Hebrew psalmist
said of God, “Like as a father pitieth his
children, even so is the Lord merciful”; and
Akhnaton, many a century before those words
were written, attributed just such a nature to
the Aton. The Aton was compassionate, was
merciful, was gentle, was tender; He knew not
anger, and there was no wrath in Him. His
overflowing love reached down the paths of life
from mankind to the beasts of the field and to
the little flowers themselves. “All flowers blow,”
says one of Akhnaton’s hymns, “and that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
grows on the soil thrives at Thy dawning, O
Aton. They drink their fill [of warmth] before
Thy face. All cattle leap upon their feet; the
birds that were in the nest fly forth with joy;
their wings which were closed move quickly with
praise to the living Aton.”</p>

<p>One stands amazed as one reads in pompous
Egypt of a god who listens “when the chicken
crieth in the egg-shell,” and gives him life,
delighting that he should “chirp with all his
might” when he is hatched forth; who finds
pleasure in causing “the birds to flutter in their
marshes, and the sheep to dance upon their
feet.” For the first time in the history of man
the real meaning of God, as we now understand
it, had been comprehended; and the idea of a
beneficent Creator who, though remote, spiritual,
and impersonal, could love each one of His
creatures, great or small, had been grasped by
this young Pharaoh. God’s unspeakable goodness
and loving-kindness were as clearly interpreted
by Akhnaton as ever they have been by
mortal man; and the wonder of it lies in this,
that Akhnaton had absolutely nothing to base
his theories upon. He was, so far as we know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the first man to whom God revealed Himself as
the passionless, all-loving essence of unqualified
goodness.</p>


<h3>3. ATON WORSHIPPED AT SUNRISE AND SUNSET.</h3>

<p>In order to prevent the more ignorant of
his disciples from worshipping the sun itself,
Akhnaton seems to have selected the sunrise
and the sunset as the two hours for ceremonial
adoration; for then the light, the beauty, the
tenderness, of the celestial phenomenon could be
appreciated, and the awful majesty of the sun was
not in great prominence. Akhnaton attempted
to cultivate in his followers an appreciation of
the gentle hues of daybreak and of evening;
and he taught them to believe that the oft-mentioned
“beauties” of the Aton were only to
be fully understood at these times. In the gladness
of sunrise and in the hush of the sunset,
the emotions are most apt to be touched and
moved; for in Egypt there is always praise in
the heart in the cool opalescence of the dawn,
and in the red dusk there is many and many a
dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Phrases such as the following may be gleaned
from Akhnaton’s hymns: “Thy rising is beautiful
in the horizon of heaven, O living Aton, who
dispensest life; shining from the eastern horizon
of heaven, Thou fillest Egypt with Thy beauty.”
“Thy setting is beautiful, O living Aton, ... who
guidest ... all countries that they may
make laudations at Thy dawning and at Thy
setting.” “When the Aton rises all the land
is in joy; His rays produce eyes for all that He
has created; and men say, ‘It is life to see Him,
there is death in not seeing Him.’” “When
Thou settest alive,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> O Aton, West and East give
praise to thee.” “Thou settest behind the
western horizon; Thou settest in life and gladness,
and every eye rejoices though they are
in darkness after Thou settest.” “When Thou
hast risen they live; when Thou settest they
die.”</p>

<p>The ceremonial side of the religion does not
seem to have been complex. The priests, of
whom there were very few, offered sacrifices,
consisting mostly of vegetables, fruit, and flowers,
to the Aton, and at these ceremonies the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and his family often officiated. They then sang
psalms and offered prayers, and, with much
sweet music, gave praise to the great Father of
joy and love. The Aton, however, was not
thought to delight in these ceremonies as He
did in more natural thanksgivings. Why should
God be praised in set phrases and studied poses
when all the fair world was shouting for the
joy of Him? The young calf frisking through
the poppy-covered meadows, the birds singing
upon the trees, the clouds racing across the
sky, were the true worshippers of God.</p>

<p>One of the recently discovered sayings of
Christ closely parallels Akhnaton’s utterances.
“Ye ask,” it runs, “who are those that draw
us to the kingdom if the kingdom is in heaven?
The fowls of the air, and all the beasts that
are under the earth or upon the earth, and the
fishes in the sea, these are they which draw
you, and the kingdom is within you.” The
contemplation of nature was more to Akhnaton
than many ceremonies, and his thoughts were
more easily drawn upwards by the rustle of
the leaves than by the shaking of the systrum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<h3>4. THE GOODNESS OF ATON.</h3>

<p>In the gardens of the City of the Horizon
Akhnaton was surrounded on all sides by the
joyous beauties of nature. Here the birds sang
merrily in the laden trees, here the cool north
wind rustled through the leaves, setting them
dancing upon their stems, here the many-coloured
blossoms nodded to their reflections in
the still lakes; and, as he watched the sunlight
playing with the blue shadows, his heart
seemed to fill to repletion with gratitude to
God. “O Lord, how manifold are Thy works!”
was his constant cry. “The whole land is in
joy and holiday because of Thee. They shout
to the height of heaven, they receive joy and
gladness when they see Thee.” How “fair of
form” was the formless Aton, how “radiant of
colour”! “All that Thou hast made,” said the
king, “leaps before Thee.” “Thou makest the
beauty of form through Thyself alone.” “Eyes
have life at sight of Thy beauty; hearts have
health when the Aton shines.”</p>

<p>As the psalmist sang, “The Lord is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
shepherd, I shall not want,” so Akhnaton, in
the fulness of his heart, cried, “There is no
poverty for him who hath set Thee in his
heart; such an one cannot say, ‘O, that I had.’”
“When Thou bringest life to men’s hearts by Thy
beauty, there is indeed life.” The Aton “gave
health to the eyes by His rays,” and, “bright,
great, gleaming, high above all the earth,” he
was “the cause of plenty,”&mdash;the very “food and
fatness of Egypt.” To David, several centuries
later, God seemed to be “a strong tower of
defence”; and, thinking along the same lines,
Akhnaton called the Aton his “wall of brass of
a million cubits.” The Aton was “the witness
of that which pertains to eternity,” and to those
whose thoughts had strayed he was “the remembrancer
of eternity.” He was the “Lord
of Fate,” the “Lord of Fortune,” the “Master
of that which is ordained,” the “Origin of
Fate,” the “Chance which gives Life”; and in
so describing him Akhnaton reached a philosophical
position which even to-day is quite
unassailable.</p>

<p>Unlike Jehovah, who was described as “great
above all other gods,” the Aton was conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
as being without rivals; and Akhnaton now
never mentions the word “gods.” “The living
Aton beside whom there is no other,” is one
of the common phrases; and of Him again it is
written, “Thou art alone, but infinite vitalities
are in Thee by means of which to give life to
Thy creatures.”</p>

<p>Unlike Jehovah again, who was not infrequently
thought to be a wrathful god, surrounded
by clouds and darkness, and speaking through
the roar of the thunders, the Aton was the
“Lord of Peace,” who could not tolerate battle
and strife. Akhnaton was so opposed to war
that he persistently refused to offer an armed resistance
to the subsequent revolts which occurred
in his Asiatic dominions. The Aton was a deity
to whose tender heart human bloodshed made
no appeal. In an age of martial glory, when
the sword and buckler, the plumed helmet and
the shirt of mail, glittered in every street and
upon every highway, Akhnaton set himself in
opposition to all heroics, and saw God without
melodrama.</p>

<p>Above all things the Aton loved truth. Frankness,
sincerity, straightforwardness, honesty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
veracity were qualities not always to be found
in the heart of an Egyptian; and Akhnaton, in
antagonism to the sins of hypocrisy and deception
which he saw around him, always spoke of
himself as “living in truth.” “I have set truth
in my inward parts,” says one of his followers,
“and falsehood is my loathing; for I know that
the King rejoiceth in truth.”</p>


<h3>5. AKHNATON THE “SON OF GOD” BY
TRADITIONAL RIGHT.</h3>

<p>It may be understood how the boy longed for
truth in all things when one remembers the
thousand exaggerated conventions of Egyptian
life at this time. Court etiquette had developed
to a degree which rendered life to the Pharaoh
an endless round of unnatural poses of mind and
body. In the preaching of his doctrine of truth
and simplicity Akhnaton did not fail to call
upon his subjects to regard their Pharaoh not
as a celestial god, as had been the custom, but
as a man, though, of course, one of divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
origin. It was usual for the Pharaoh to keep
aloof from his people: Akhnaton was to be
found in their midst. The court demanded that
their lord should drive in solitary state through
the city: Akhnaton stood in his chariot with
his wife and children, and allowed the artist
to represent him joking therein with his little
daughter. In portraying the Pharaoh the artist
was expected to draw him in some conventional
attitude of dignity: Akhnaton insisted upon
being shown in all manner of natural attitudes&mdash;now
leaning languidly upon a staff, now nursing
his children, and now eating his dinner.
Thus again one sees his objection to heroics,
and his love of naturalness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_130_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Akhnaton driving with his Wife and Daughter.</em></div>
</div>

<p>But while he strove for truth and sincerity
in this manner he did not attempt to remove
from his mind the belief in which he had been
brought up, that as Pharaoh of Egypt he was
himself partly divine. Not only was he by
reason of his religion the representative, and
hence, in a manner of speech, the “son” of
God, but by right of royal descent he was the
“son of the Sun.” The names of the Pharaohs
were always surrounded by an oval band, known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
as a cartouche, which was the distinguishing
mark of a royal name. Akhnaton wrote the
name of the Aton within such an oval, thus
indicating that the Pharaoh’s royal rights were
also held by, and therefore derived from, God
Himself. There was thus, as Christ later taught
His disciples to believe, a kingdom of heaven
over which God presided; and although impersonal,
intangible, and incomprehensible, the
Aton was the very “King of kings, the only
ruler of princes.” Amon-Ra and other of the
old deities had been called at various times
“King of the gods.” Akhnaton, however, applied
to Aton the words “King and God.”</p>

<p>Akhnaton is spoken of as “the unique one
of Ra, whose beauties Aton created,” and as
“the beloved son of Aton,” whom “Aton bare.”
Addressing the Aton, his courtiers were wont to
say, “Thy rays are on Thy bright image, the
Ruler of Truth (<em>i.e.</em>, the King), who proceeded
from eternity. Thou givest to him Thy duration
and Thy years; Thou hearkenest to all
that is in his heart, because Thou lovest him.
Thou makest him like the Aton, him Thy child,
the King.” “Thou lookest on him, for he pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>ceeded<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
from Thee.” “Thou hast placed him
beside Thee for ever and ever, for he loves to
gaze upon Thee.... Thou hast set him there
till the swan shall turn black and the crow turn
white, till the hills rise up to travel and the
deeps rush into the rivers.” “While heaven is,
he shall be.” Some of the Pharaohs had called
themselves “the beautiful child of Amon”; and
Akhnaton, borrowing this phrase, was sometimes
spoken of as “the beautiful child of the
Aton.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_134_fp.jpg" width="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Akhnaton and his Wife and Children.</em></div>
</div>

<p>In his capacity as Pharaoh and “son of God,”
Akhnaton demanded and received a very considerable
amount of ceremonial homage; but
he never blinded himself to the fact that
he was primarily but a simple man. He
most sincerely wished that his private life
should be a worthy example to his subjects,
and he earnestly desired that it should be
observed in all its naturalness and simplicity.
He did his utmost to elevate the position of
women and the sanctity of the family by dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>playing
to the world the ideal conditions of his
own married life. He made a point of caressing
his wife in public, putting his arm around her
neck in the sight of all men. As we have seen,
one of his forms of oath was, “As my heart is
happy in the Queen and her children....”
He spoke of his wife always as “Mistress of
his happiness, ... at hearing whose voice
the King rejoices.” “Lady of grace” was she,
“great of love” and “fair of face.” Every
wish that she expressed, declared Akhnaton,
was executed by him. Even on the most ceremonious
occasions the queen sat beside her
husband and held his hand, while their children
frolicked around them; for such things pleased
that gentle father more than the savour of
burnt-offerings. It is seldom that the Pharaoh
is represented in the reliefs without his family;
and, in opposition to all tradition, the queen
is shown upon the same scale of size and importance
as that of her husband. Akhnaton’s
devotion to his children is very marked, and
he taught his disciples to believe that God
was the father, the mother, the nurse, and
the friend of the young. Thus, though “son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of God,” Akhnaton preached the beauty of the
human family, and laid stress on the sanctity
of marriage and parenthood.</p>


<h3>6. THE CONNECTIONS OF THE ATON WORSHIP
WITH OLDER RELIGIONS.</h3>

<p>In developing his religion Akhnaton must
have come into almost daily conflict with the
priesthoods of the old gods of Egypt; and even
the Heliopolitan Ra-Horakhti, from which his
own faith had been evolved, now fell far short
of his ideals. He does not seem, however, to
have yet imposed the worship of the Aton upon
the provinces, nor to have persecuted the
various priesthoods. He hoped, no doubt, that
he would be able to persuade the whole country
to his views as soon as those views were
thoroughly matured; and, secure in his new city,
he was free to purge his religion of its faults
before declaring all other creeds illegal.</p>

<p>It is probable that the sacred bull, Mnevis,
was banished from his ceremonies at an early
date, for no tombs seem to have been made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
these holy creatures, and they are not referred
to after the sixth year of the king’s reign. The
priests of Heliopolis would now have hardly
recognised their doctrines in the exalted faith
of the Aton, though here and there some point
of close contact might have been observed. One
may also detect slight resemblances to the
Adonis religions of Syria, from whence the Aton
had originally come. Mention has already been
made of the worship of Adonis. So widespread
was that deity’s power that it very naturally
affected many other religions. In the Biblical
Psalms one finds several echoes of this old pagan
worship, as for example in the lines from
Psalm xix., which read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="verse0">Which is a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,</p>
<p class="verse0">And he rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.</p>
<p class="verse0">There is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Here one surely must recognise the youthful
Adonis, the bridegroom of Venus. And similarly
in the Heliopolitan worship, at the commencement
of Akhnaton’s reign, the sun, Ra, is referred
to in the following terms: “Thou art beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and youthful as Aton before thy mother Hathor
[Venus].”</p>

<p>In Akhnaton’s religion one may still catch a
fleeting glimpse of Adonis. One of the king’s
courtiers, named May, held the office of “Overseer
of the House for sending Aton to rest.”<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Akhnaton’s queen is mentioned in the tomb of
Ay under the peculiar title of “She who sends
the Aton to rest with a sweet voice, and with
her two beautiful hands bearing two systrums.”
This “house” was, no doubt, the temple at which
the vesper prayers to the Aton were said at
sunset, and from the above title of the queen it
would seem that she had particular charge of
these evening ceremonies. One cannot contemplate
the fact that it was a woman who officiated
at a ceremony which consisted of a lament<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> for
the death of the sun without seeing in it some
connection, however faint, with the story of
Venus and Adonis. The lament of Venus for
the death of Adonis&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, the setting of the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>&mdash;was
one of the fundamental ceremonies of the
Mediterranean religions. Here again was a connection
with an older religion for Akhnaton to
consider and perhaps to purge away; and one
may suppose that all such derivatives from
earlier faiths were gradually eliminated as the
young king developed his creed. Soon not a
scrap of superstition remained in the religion;
and one may credit this Pharaoh of three thousand
years ago with as great a freedom from the
trammels of traditional superstition as that of
the advanced thinker of to-day.</p>


<h3>7. THE SPIRITUAL NEEDS OF THE SOUL
AFTER DEATH.</h3>

<p>“Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing
it is for the eyes to behold the sun,” says Holy
Writ in words which might have fallen from
the lips of Akhnaton; “but though a man live
many years and rejoice in them all, yet let him
remember the days of darkness, for they shall
be many.” As Akhnaton had completely revolutionised
the beliefs of the Egyptians as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the nature of God, so he altered and purged
their theories regarding the existence of the
soul after death. According to the old beliefs,
as we have seen, the soul of a man had to pass
through awful places up to the judgment throne
of Osiris, where he was weighed in the balances.
If he was found wanting he was devoured by a
ferocious monster, but if the scales turned in
his favour he was accepted into the Elysian
fields. So many were the spirits, bogies, and
demigods which he was likely to meet before
the goal was reached that he had to know by
heart a tedious string of formulæ, the correct
repetition of which, and the correct making
of the related magic, alone ensured his safe
passage.</p>

<p>Akhnaton flung all these formulæ into the
fire. Djins, bogies, spirits, monsters, demigods,
demons, and Osiris himself with all his court,
were swept into the blaze and reduced to ashes.
Akhnaton believed that when a man died his
soul continued to exist as a kind of astral,
immaterial ghost, sometimes resting in the
dreamy halls of heaven, and sometimes visiting,
in shadowy form, the haunts of the earthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
life. By some of the inscriptions one is led to
suppose that, as in the fourth article of the
Christian faith, so in the teachings of Akhnaton,
the body was thought to take again after death
its “flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to
the perfection of man’s nature.” But just as
there is some doubt and some vagueness in the
mind of Christian thinkers as to the meaning
of this article, so in Akhnaton’s doctrine there
was some uncertainty as to whether the body
was entirely spiritual or in a manner material
in its hazy existence in the Hills of the West.
The disembodied soul still craved the pleasures
of earthly life and shunned its sorrows; still felt
hunger and thirst and enjoyed a draught of water
or a meal of solid food; still warmed itself in
the sunshine or sought coolness in the shadows.</p>

<p>We hear nothing of hell; for Akhnaton, in the
tenderness of his heart, could not bring himself
to believe that God would allow suffering in
any of His creatures, however sinful. The inscriptions
seem rather to indicate that there was
no future life for the wicked,&mdash;that they were
annihilated; though in almost every man one
may suppose that there was enough good to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
recommend him to the mercy of a God so loving
as the Aton.</p>

<p>The first great wish of the deceased was that
he might each day leave the dim underworld in
order to see the light of the sun upon earth.
This had been the prayer of the Egyptians from
time immemorial, and to suit the religion of
the Aton its wording alone was changed. The
disciple of Akhnaton asked to be allowed “to
go out from the underworld in the morning to
see Aton as he rises.” He prayed insistently,
passionately, in varied language, that his spirit
might “go forth to see the sun’s rays,” that his
“two eyes might be opened to see the sun,”
that there might be “no failure to see it,” that
the “vision of the sun’s fair face might never be
lost to him,” that he “might obtain a sight of
the beauty of each recurring sunrise,” and that
“the sun’s rays might spread over his body.”
Sometimes it is the Aton whom the soul thus
craves to see; sometimes it is Ra, the sun; but
always it seems to be the actual light and
warmth of the sunshine which is so passionately
desired. The abstract conditions of the future
life could but be interpreted in terms of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
experience; and in contemplating that cold, desolate
mystery of death, Akhnaton could find no
better means of banishing the gloom than by
praying for a continuance of the blessed light
of the day. And the man who prayed that his
soul might see the sunshine but asked that he
might still know the joy of the presence of
God, for God was the light of the world.</p>

<p>His second wish was that he might retain the
favour of the king and queen after death, and
that his soul might serve their souls in the
palaces of the dead. He asks for “readiness in
the presence of the King” to do his bidding; he
prays that he may be admitted into the palace,
“entering it in favour and leaving it in love”;
that he may “attend the King every day”; and
that he may “receive honour in the presence of
the King.”</p>

<p>For his mental contentment in the underworld
he earnestly desired that “his name
might be remembered and established on earth,”
that there might be “a happy memory of him
in the King’s palace,” and “a continuance of his
name in the mouths of the courtiers,” where he
hoped that it “might be welcome.” “May my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
name thrive in the tomb-chapel,” he says. “May
my name not be to seek in my mansion. May
it be celebrated for ever.” So, too, at the present
day the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In Memoriam</i> are goodly words;
and that a man’s memory may be kept green is
a thing very generally desired.</p>


<h3>8. THE MATERIAL NEEDS OF THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>In order that the soul might have its link
with earth, the worshipper of the Aton prayed
that his mummy might remain “firm” and
uncorrupted, that the “flesh might live upon
the bones,” and that his limbs might remain
“knit together.” The Egyptians of other days
believed that the body itself would live again
at the resurrection, this being the reason why
they attempted so carefully to preserve it; and
Akhnaton does not appear to have altered this
conception of the nature of the material body. So,
too, in the Christian faith it is thought that at
the last day the graves will give up their dead.</p>

<p>The spiritual body retained the form and the
individuality of the material body, and therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in a somewhat vague manner, it was thought
that the needs of the soul would not be very
dissimilar from those of the body upon earth.
Christ, after His resurrection, asked for food;
and the feasts of Paradise are more than allegory
to many a Christian. Likewise the follower of
Akhnaton believed that material food, or its
spiritual equivalent, would be necessary to the
soul’s welfare in the next world. “May I be
called by my name,” says he, “and come at the
summons, in order to feed upon the good things
provided upon the temple altar.” It would seem
that through fidelity to the Aton creed he might
have the privilege of partaking of the offerings
made at the great ceremonies in the temple;
for, after these sacrifices had been offered, the
food, probably, was distributed to the priests
and to those attached to the tombs, who represented
the interests of the dead. Thus the
deceased prays that he may enjoy “a reception
of that which has been offered in the temple”;
“a reception of offerings of the King’s giving in
every shrine”; “a drink-offering in the temple of
Aton”; “food deposited on the altar every
day”; and “everything that is offered in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sanctuary of Aton in the City of the Horizon of
Aton.” He further asks that “wine may be
poured out” for him, and that “the children of
his house may spill a libation for him at the
entrance of his tomb.”</p>

<p>While life lasted God was very apparent to
those who sought Him. Wherever the sun
shone, wherever the great pulse of the earth
beat beneath one, wherever the river flowed or
the garden bloomed, there was God to be found;
for God was happiness, was beauty, was love.
But when the cold mists of death had enveloped
a man, when there was no longer any spring-time
nor any opening of the blossoms, how should
there be contentment any more? From the
depths of his heart Akhnaton urged his followers
to pray God that He might provide this happiness,
though it could only be voiced in very
human words. It was not “sweet perfume” nor
“the smell of incense” that the soul required;
but how else could the pleasure of light-heartedness
be worded? They prayed that their “limbs
might be provided with pleasure every day.” In
the stagnant air of the tomb they craved for the
touch of the “sweet breeze,” for “the breath of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the pleasant airs of the north wind.” They hoped
in shadowy form to be able to visit the beloved
scenes of their lifetime. “May I raise myself up
and forget languor,” prays one. “May I leave
and enter my mansion,” says another. “May my
soul not be shut off from that which it desires.
May I walk as I will in the grove that I have
made upon earth. May I drink the water at
the edge of my lake every day without ceasing.”
“May water be poured out from my cistern,”
cries a third; “may I receive fruit from my
trees.” Incessantly each man implores God to
grant that he may cool his parched lips with
water. “A draught of water at the banks of
the river,” is his desire; “a draught of water at
the swirl of the stream.” While he smells “the
scent of the wind” blowing amidst the petals
of “a bouquet of Aton,” and while there runs “a
brook of water” by his side, he need not know
the horror of death. And thus, by receiving
“everything good and sweet,” he may hope for
“health and prosperity” in the hills and the
valleys of the West; for a “happy life, provided
with pleasure and joy,” for “amusement, merriment,
and delight,” and for a “daily rejoicing”
throughout eternity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be argued that this material conception
of the life after death is not equal in purity of
tone to the faith of the Aton. But is it, then,
less lofty to believe in a heaven in which there
is joy and laughter, a scent of flowers, and a
breath of north wind, than in one where the
streets are paved with gold, and where there
are many mansions? By no religion in the
world is Christianity so closely approached as
by the faith of Akhnaton; and if the Pharaoh’s
doctrines as to immortality are not altogether
convincing, neither are the Christian doctrines,
as they are now interpreted, altogether without
fault. In the above pages it has been necessary
always to compare Akhnaton’s creed with
Christianity, since there is so much common to
the two religions; but it should be remembered
that this comparison must of necessity be unfavourable
to the Pharaoh’s doctrine, revealing
as it does its shortcomings. Let the reader
remember that Akhnaton lived some thirteen
hundred years before the birth of Christ, at an
age when the world was steeped in superstition
and sunk in the fogs of idolatry. Bearing this
in mind, he will not fail to see in that tenderly
loving Father whom the boy-Pharaoh worshipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
an early revelation of the God to whom we of
the present day bow down; and once more he
will find how true are the words&mdash;</p>

<p class="fs80 pad4">“God fulfils Himself in many ways.”</p>

<p>Since writing the above, another point in Akhnaton’s
teaching has become apparent, from the
scenes, recently discovered by the present writer,
in the tomb of Rames. There is a scene often
represented upon the walls of tombs of Dynasty
XVIII. which seems to represent human sacrifice.
The figure of a man is seen dragged to the tomb
upon a sledge, and Sir Gaston Maspero has pointed
out that this can hardly be anything else than such
a sacrifice. This scene was shown on one of the
walls of the tomb of Rames, and evidently dated
from a period previous to Akhnaton’s revolution.
When, however, the young king had formulated
his religion of love he could not tolerate a barbaric
and cruel ceremony of this kind. We thus find
that the entire scene is here obliterated, almost
certainly by the king’s agents. The objection
to human sacrifice is closely in accord with
his objection to human suffering as recorded on
<a href="#Page_175">page 175</a>.</p>

<h3>1. THE HYMNS OF THE ATON WORSHIPPERS.</h3>


<p class="noindent">In the tombs of rich persons who had lived
and died previous to the time of Akhnaton,
a large portion of the walls had been covered
with religious inscriptions; and when at first
the nobles of the City of the Horizon of Aton
were planning their sepulchres they must have
been at a loss to know what to substitute for
these forbidden formulæ. Soon, however, it
became the custom to write there short extracts
from the hymns which were sung in
the temples of the Aton. In a few cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
these inscriptions supply us with a definite
psalm which, although short, seems to be
complete. In one tomb&mdash;that of Ay&mdash;however,
there is a copy of a much more elaborate
hymn; and it would thus seem that there
were two main psalms in use in the temples,
a longer and a shorter version of the same
composition.</p>

<p>It was not unusual for the Egyptians to
compose hymns in honour of their gods, and
a few such have been preserved to us upon
the walls of the old temples. Like the Hebrew
psalms of later date, they are not always of a
very high moral tone. They are often but
chants of victory, dealing in battles, in
thunders, and in tempests, and glorying in
the wrath of heaven. The longer hymn to
the Aton, which is here given in full, is quite
unlike any of these compositions, and both in
purity of tone and in beauty of style it must
rank high amongst the poems of antiquity.</p>

<h3>2. THE SIMILARITY OF AKHNATON’S HYMN
TO PSALM CIV.</h3>

<p>In reading this truly beautiful hymn one
cannot fail to be struck by its similarity to
Psalm civ. A parallel will show this most
clearly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="textcol">

<p><span class="smcap pad2">Akhnaton’s Hymn.</span></p>

<p>
The world is in darkness
like the dead. Every lion
cometh forth from his den;
all serpents sting. Darkness
reigns.</p>
<br />
<p>
When Thou risest in the
horizon ... the darkness is
banished.... Then in all
the world they do their work.</p>
<br />
<p>
All trees and plants flourish,
... the birds flutter in their
marshes.... All sheep dance
upon their feet.</p>
<br />
<p>
The ships sail up-stream and
down-stream alike.... The
fish in the river leap up before
Thee; and Thy rays are in the
midst of the great sea.</p>

<p>
How manifold are all Thy
works!... Thou didst create
the earth according to Thy desire,&mdash;men,
all cattle, ... all
that are upon the earth....</p>
<br />
<p>
Thou hast set a Nile in
heaven that it may fall for
them, making floods upon the
mountains ... and watering
their fields. The Nile in
heaven is for the service of
the strangers, and for the
cattle of every land.</p>

<p>
Thou makest the seasons....
Thou hast made the
distant heaven in order to
rise therein, ... dawning,
shining afar off, and returning.</p>

<p>
The world is in Thy hand,
even as Thou hast made them.
When thou hast risen they live;
when Thou settest they die....
By Thee man liveth.</p>

   </div><div class="textcol">

<p><span class="smcap pad2">Psalm civ.</span></p>

<p>
Thou makest the darkness
and it is night, wherein all
the beasts of the forest do
creep forth. The young lions
roar after their prey; they seek
their meat from God.</p>

<p>
The sun riseth, they get them
away, and lay them down in
their dens. Man goeth forth
unto his work, and to his
labour until the evening.</p>

<p>
The trees of the Lord are
full of sap, ... wherein the
birds make their nests....
The high hills are a refuge for
the wild goats.</p>

Yonder is the sea, great and

small and great beasts. There
go the ships....</p>
<br />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>
O Lord, how manifold are
Thy works! In wisdom hast
Thou made them all. The
earth is full of Thy creatures.</p>
<br />
<p>
He watereth the hills from
above: the earth is filled with
the fruit of Thy works. He
bringeth forth grass for the
cattle, and green herb for the
service of men.</p>
<br />
<p>
He appointed the moon for
certain seasons, and the sun
knoweth his going down.</p>
<br />
<p>
These wait all upon Thee....
When Thou givest them [food]
they gather it; and when Thou
openest Thy hand they are filled
with good. When Thou hidest
Thy face they are troubled:
when Thou takest away their
breath they die.</p>
    </div>

<p>In face of this remarkable similarity one can
hardly doubt that there is a direct connection
between the two compositions; and it becomes
necessary to ask whether both Akhnaton’s hymn
and this Hebrew psalm were derived from a
common Syrian source, or whether Psalm civ. is
derived from this Pharaoh’s original poem. Both
views are admissible; but in consideration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Akhnaton’s peculiar ability and originality there
seems considerable likelihood that he is the author
in the first instance of this gem of the Psalter.</p>

<p>When the young Pharaoh composed this hymn
he was probably neither much more nor less than
twenty or twenty-one years of age,&mdash;a period of
life at which many of the world’s greatest poets
have written some of their fairest poems. One
sees that he believed himself to be the only
man to whom God had revealed Himself; and
the fact that he never admits that he was in
any way taught to regard God as he did, but
always speaks of himself, and is spoken of, as
the originator and teacher of the faith, indicates
that the ideas expressed in the hymn were
entirely his own.</p>


<h3>3. MERYRA IS MADE HIGH PRIEST OF ATON.</h3>

<p>The religion of the Aton had now assumed shape
and symmetry, and had been firmly established
in the new capital as the creed of the court.
Akhnaton was thus able to intrust its administration
and organisation there to one of his nobles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
who had hearkened to his teaching, and to turn
his attention to other affairs, and more especially
to the conversion of the rest of Egypt. As head
of the state a thousand matters daily claimed
his consideration, and his high principles led
him to stray further along the by-paths of
administration than had been the wont of the
Pharaohs before him. His ill-health did not
permit him to tax his brain with impunity, and
yet there was never a king of Egypt before or
after him whose mind was so fruitful of thoughts
and of schemes. The young king himself expounded
to his followers the doctrines which he
wished them to embrace, and one may suppose
that he sat for many an hour in the halls of
his palace, or under the trees in the gardens
beside the Nile, earnestly telling of the beauties
of the Aton to officials and nobles.</p>

<p>No one had accepted the king’s teaching with
greater readiness than a certain Meryra, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'who seens to have'">who
seems to have</ins> early associated himself with the
movement; and it was to him that Akhnaton
now handed over the office of “High Priest of
the Aton in the City of the Horizon of Aton,”
in order to free himself for the great task of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
administering his kingdom and converting it to
his way of thinking. Unfortunately we know
very little of the career of Meryra, but on the
walls of his tomb in the hills behind the capital
there are a few reliefs which may here be
described as illustrating events in his life and
in the life of Akhnaton.</p>

<p>One of these scenes shows us the investiture
of Meryra as High Priest. The king is seen
with his wife and one of his daughters standing
at a window of the gaily decorated <em>loggia</em> of
the palace. The sill of the window is massed
with bright-coloured cushions, and over these
the royal personages lean forward to address
Meryra and the company assembled in the
pillared gallery outside. The outer surface of
the <em>loggia</em> wall is brightly ornamented either
with real or painted garlands of lotus-flowers,
and with the many-coloured patterns usual upon
such buildings in ancient Egypt. Ribbons, fluttering
in the breeze, hang from the delicate lotus-pillars
which support the roof, and vie in brilliancy
with the red and blue ostrich-plume fans and
standards carried by the officials.</p>

<p>Leaning from the window, with arm outstretched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Akhnaton bids Meryra rise from his
knees, on to which he had cast himself on reaching
the royal presence. Then solemnly the king
addresses his favoured disciple in the following
words:&mdash;“Behold, I make thee High Priest of
the Aton for me in the Temple of the Aton in
the City of the Horizon of Aton. I do this for
love of thee, and I say unto thee: O my servant
who hearkenest to the teaching, my heart is
satisfied with everything which thou hast done.
I give thee this office, and I say unto thee: thou
shalt eat the food of Pharaoh, thy lord, in the
Temple of Aton.”</p>

<p>Immediately the assembled company crowd
round Meryra and lift him shoulder-high,
while the new High Priest cries, “Abundant
are the rewards which the Aton knows to give
when his heart is pleased.” The king then
presents Meryra with the insignia of his office,
and with various costly gifts, which are taken
charge of by the servants and attendants who
stand outside the gallery. Behind these attendants,
at the outskirts of the scene, one observes
the chariot which is to convey the High
Priest back to his villa; fan-bearers who shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
run before and behind him; women of the
household who shall beat upon tambourines at
the head of the procession, and who already
dance with excitement as they see Meryra
hoisted on to his friend’s shoulder; and still
other women who shall make the roadway rich
with flowers.</p>

<p>This is no solemn and occult initiation of an
ascetic into the mystery of the new religion,
but rather the elevation of a good fellow to a
popular post of honour. There was no mystery
in the faith of the Aton. Frankness, openness,
and sincerity were the dominant themes of
Akhnaton’s teaching,&mdash;a worship of God in the
blessed light of the day, the singing of merry
psalms in the open courts of the temple; and
the chosen High Priest was more likely to have
been a deep-thinking, clean-lived, honest-hearted,
God-fearing, family man, than an ascetic who
had abandoned the pomps and the vanities of
this world. The point at which Akhnaton’s
religion differs most widely from Christianity
is here to be observed: the Pharaoh, while encouraging
the Simple Life, did not preach the
mortification of the flesh, but only the control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of the body. The comforts of life, the brilliancy
of decoration, the charms of music, the beauties
of painting and sculpture, the pleasure of good
company, the tonic of a bowl of wine, were all
as acceptable to him, in moderation, as to the
Preacher in Ecclesiastes.</p>


<h3>4. THE ROYAL FAMILY VISIT THE TEMPLE.</h3>

<p>When Meryra had been installed, the king
and royal family made a formal visit to the
temple at the time of sunset, and this is likewise
represented in the High Priest’s tomb. For
the first time in the history of Egypt one is
permitted to see the Pharaoh as he drove
through the streets of the capital in his chariot.
No king before Akhnaton had allowed an artist
to represent him in aught but celestial poses;
but out of his love for truth and reality
Akhnaton had dispensed with this convention,
and encouraged the regarding of himself as a
mortal man. On this occasion we see him standing
in his gorgeously decorated chariot, reins
and whip in hand, himself driving the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
spirited horses, the coloured ostrich plumes on
whose heads nod and toss as the superb animals
prance along. The queen, also driving her own
chariot, follows close behind; and after her
again come the princesses, heading a noble
group of chariots belonging to the court officials
and ladies-in-waiting, these being driven by
charioteers. The shining harness, the dancing
red and blue plumes of the horses, the many-coloured
robes, the feathered standards of the
nobles, the fluttering ribbons, all go to make
the cavalcade a sight to bring the townspeople
running from their houses. A guard of soldiers,
armed with spears, shields, battle-axes, bows,
and clubs, races along on foot in front of the
royal party to clear the road. Here, besides
Egyptians, are bearded Asiatics from the king’s
Syrian dominions, befeathered negroes from the
Mazoi tribes of Nubia, and Libyans from the
west, wearing the plaited side-lock of hair hanging
from their heads.</p>

<p>The party is seen to be nearing the temple,
and Meryra stands before the gateway ready to
greet his lord. Four men kneel near him holding
aloft the coloured ostrich-plume fans, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
will be wafted to and fro above the king’s head
when he has alighted from his chariot; and
others kneel, lifting their hands in reverent
salutation. Great bulls, fattened like the prize
cattle of modern times, are led forth, garlands
of flowers thrown around their huge necks, and
bouquets of flowers fastened between their horns.
These are attended by grooms, also bearing
bunches of flowers. Two groups of female musicians,
clad in flowing robes, wave their arms and
beat upon tambourines.</p>

<p>The temple, which will be described later, is
this day garlanded with flowers, and every altar
is heaped high with offerings. Now the king
has entered the building, and a further scene
shows the royal family worshipping at the high
altar, which is piled up with offerings of joints
of meat, geese, vegetables, fruit, and flowers,
surmounted by bronze bowls filled with burning
oil. Akhnaton and Nefertiti stand before the
altar, each with the right arm raised in the act
of sprinkling the fragrant gums of Araby upon
the flames. The upper part of the king’s body
is bare, but from his waist depends a graceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
skirt of fine linen, ornamented with sash-like
ribbons of a red material, which flutter about
his bare legs. The queen’s robe covers the whole
of her body, but is so transparent that one can
see her fair form with almost the distinctness
of nudity. A red sash is bound round her waist,
and the two ends fall almost to the ground.
Neither of the two wears any jewels; and the
simplicity of the soft, flowing robes, with their
bright-red sashes, is extremely marked. Two
little princesses stand behind the king and queen,
each shaking from a systrum a note of praise
to God. Meryra, accompanied by an assistant,
stands bowing before the king, and near by another
priest burns some sweet-smelling incense.
Not far away there sits a group of eight blind
musicians,&mdash;fat elderly men, who clap their
hands and sing to the accompaniment of a
seven-stringed harp, giving praise to the sunlight
which they cannot see, but yet can feel
as “the heat which is in Aton” penetrates into
their bones.</p>

<p>In still another series of reliefs we are shown
a scene representing the reward of Meryra by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Akhnaton on some occasion when he had been
particularly successful in collecting the yearly
dues of the temple from the estates on the opposite
bank of the river. The ceremony took
place in the granary buildings at the edge of
the water. One sees a group of boats moored
at the quay, and on the shore are several cattle-pens
filled with lowing cattle. The granaries
are stored with all manner of good things, and
Meryra stands triumphant in front of them as
the king addresses him.</p>

<p>“Let the Superintendent of the Treasury of
the Jewels take Meryra,” says Akhnaton, “and
hang gold on his neck at the front, and gold
on his feet, because of his obedience to the
teaching of Pharaoh;” and immediately the attendants
literally heap the gold collars and
necklaces one above the other upon the High
Priest’s neck. Scribes write down a rapid summary
of the events; the attendants and fan-bearers
bow low; and Meryra is conducted back
to his village with music and with dancing, while
Akhnaton returns to his palace, and, no doubt,
sinks exhausted on to his cushions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>


<h3>5. AKHNATON IN HIS PALACE.</h3>

<p>The reliefs and paintings upon the tombs
often show the Pharaoh reclining thus, in a
languid manner, as though the duties of his
high calling had sapped all the strength from
him. Never before had a Pharaoh been represented
to his subjects in such human attitudes.
The privacy of the palace is penetrated in these
scenes, and we see the king, who loved to teach
his followers the beauty of family life, in the
midst of his own family. One or two of these
representations must here be described. In one
instance the royal family is shown inside a
beautiful pavilion, the roof of which is supported
by wooden pillars painted with many colours
and having capitals carved in high relief to
represent wild geese suspended by their legs,
and above them bunches of flowers: just such
a grouping as one might see in some sporting
house of the present day. The pillars are hung
with garlands of flowers, and from the ceiling
there droop festoons of flowers and trailing
branches of vines. The roof of the pavilion on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the outside is edged by an endless line of gleaming
cobras, probably wrought in bronze.</p>

<p>Inside this fair arbor stand a group of naked
girls playing upon the harp, the lute, and the
lyre, and, no doubt, singing to that accompaniment
the artless love-songs of the period.
Servants are shown attending to the jars of
wine which stand at the side of the enclosure.
The king is seen leaning back upon the cushions
of an arm-chair, as though tired out and sick
at heart. In the fingers of his left hand he
idly dandles a few flowers, while with his right
hand he languidly holds out a delicate bowl in
order that the wine in it may be replenished.
This is done by the queen, who is standing
before him, all solicitous for his comfort. She
pours the wine from a vessel, causing it to pass
through a strainer before flowing into the bowl.
Three little princesses stand near by: one of them
laden with bouquets of flowers, another holding
out some sweetmeat upon a dish, and a third
talking to her father.</p>

<p>In another scene the king and queen are both
shown seated upon comfortable chairs, while a
servant waits upon them. The king is eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
a roasted pigeon, holding it in his fingers; and
Nefertiti is represented drinking from a prettily
shaped cup. The light, transparent robes which
they wear indicate that this is the midday
meal; but unfortunately the painting is so much
damaged that nothing but the royal figures
remains.</p>


<h3>6. HISTORICAL EVENTS OF THIS PERIOD OF
AKHNATON’S REIGN.</h3>

<p>There is very little historical information to
be procured for these years of the king’s reign.
When he had been about ten or eleven years
upon the throne, and was some twenty-one years
of age, his fourth daughter, Nefernefernaton, was
born. The queen had presented no son to
Akhnaton to succeed him, but he does not seem
in this emergency to have cared to turn to any
secondary wives; and, as far as we can tell, he
remained all his life a monogamist, although
this was in direct opposition to all traditional
custom. Steadily during these years the king’s
health seems to have grown more precarious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
for almost daily he must have overtaxed his
strength. His brain was so active that he could
not submit to be idle; and even when he reclined
amidst the flowers in his garden, his
whole soul was straining upwards in the attempt
to pierce the barrier which lay between him and
the God who had caused those flowers to bloom.
The maturity of his creed at this period leads
one to suppose that he had given to it his very
life’s force; and when it is remembered that
at the same time his attention was occupied by
the administration of a kingdom which he had
twisted out of all semblance to its former shape,
the wonder is that his brain was at all able to
stand the incessant strain. Rare indeed must
have been those idle moments which the artists of
the City of the Horizon attempted to represent.</p>

<p>In the twelfth year of his reign, the tribute
of the vassal kingdoms reached such a high
value that a particular record was made of it,
and scenes showing its reception were sculptured
in the tombs of Huya and Meryra II.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> An inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
beside the scene in the tomb of Huya
reads thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Year twelve, the second month of winter, the
eighth day.... The King ... and the Queen
... living for ever and ever, made a public
appearance on the great palanquin of gold, to receive
the tribute of Syria and Ethiopia, and of
the west and the east. All the countries were
collected at one time, and also the islands in
the midst of the sea; bringing offerings to the
King when he was on the great throne of the
City of the Horizon of Aton, in order to receive
the imposts of every land and granting them [in
return] the breath of life.</p></div>

<p>The king and queen are shown seated in the
state palanquin side by side; and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Akhnaton holds the insignia of royalty, and is
evidently very much upon his dignity, the
queen’s arm has found its way around his waist,
and there lovingly rests for all the world to
see. The palanquin, probably made of wood
entirely covered with gold foil, is a very imposing
structure: a large double throne, borne aloft
by stout poles upon the shoulders of the court
officials. The arm-rests are carved in the form
of sphinxes, which rise above a glistening hedge
of cobras, and the throne is flanked on either
side by the figure of a lion carved in the
round. A priest walks in front of the palanquin
sending up a cloud of incense from a censer,
and professional mummers dance and skip in
the roadway in advance of the procession. Behind
the royal couple walk the princesses,
attended by their nurses and ladies; and on all
sides are arrayed courtiers, officers, soldiers, and
servants.</p>

<p>Soon the ground marked out for the ceremony
is reached, and the king and queen betake themselves
to a gorgeous little pavilion which has been
erected for them, and here they sit together
upon a double throne, their feet supported upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
hassocks. The queen sits upon Akhnaton’s left,
and in the picture her figure is hidden by that
of her husband; but as her right arm is seen
to encircle his waist, and her left hand to hold
his left hand, one may suppose that she is reclining
against him, with her royal head upon
his shoulder. Nefertiti was the mother of a
family of children, but was not more than about
twenty<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> years of age; and as she is said to have
been extremely beautiful, one may presume that
this scene of conjugal affection was not without
its charm. The little princesses cluster
round the throne, one of them holding a young
gazelle in her arms, while another strokes its
head.</p>

<p>In front of this pavilion the deputations from
the vassal kingdoms pass by; and in order that
the king may not be wearied by their ceremonious
homage, a group of professional wrestlers,
boxers, and fencers is provided for his diversion;
while near them some buffoons and mummers
dance and tumble to the accompaniment of
castanets and hand-clapping. The tribute of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Syria is brought by long-robed Asiatics, who
cast themselves upon their knees before the
throne with hands uplifted in salutation. Splendid
Syrian horses are led past, and behind
them chariots are wheeled or carried along.
Then come groups of slaves, handcuffed, but not
cruelly bound nor maltreated, as was the custom
under other Pharaohs. Bows, spears, shields,
daggers, elephant-tusks, and other objects, are
carried past and deposited upon the ground
near the pavilion; while beautiful vases of precious
metal or costly stone are held aloft for
the king to admire. Wild animals are led
across the ground by their keepers, and amongst
these a tame mountain lion must have caused
something of a sensation. Several nude girls,
selected probably for their beauty, walk past;
and one may suppose that they will find subsequent
employment amongst the handmaidens
in the palace.</p>

<p>From the “islands in the midst of the sea”
come beautiful vases, some ornamented with
figures in the round. From Libya ostrich eggs
and ostrich feathers are brought. The tribute
of Nubia and the Sudan is carried past by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
befeathered negroes, and consists mainly of bars
and rings of gold and bags of gold-dust, procured
from the mines in the Eastern Desert.
Shields, weapons, tusks, and skins are also to
be seen, and cattle and antelopes are led before
the throne. As the Asiatics had startled the
assembly by bringing with them a lion, so
the negroes cause a stir by leading forward
a panther of large size. Finally, male and
female slaves, the latter carrying their babies
in baskets upon their backs, are marched past
the pavilion; but here again these slaves are
not maltreated. It is particularly noticeable
that the groups of miserable captives which one
sees in all such scenes of other periods, with
their arms bound in agonising positions and
their knees giving way under them, are entirely
absent from the representations of Akhnaton’s
ceremonies. Human suffering was a thing hateful
to the young Pharaoh who knew so well
the meaning of physical distress; and the tortures
of the prisoners, or the beheading of some
rebel, such as would have been a feature of an
occasion of this kind under Amonhotep II., or
even, perhaps, under Amonhotep III., would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
have been as revolting to Akhnaton as it would
be to us.</p>


<h3>7. QUEEN TIY VISITS THE CITY OF THE
HORIZON.</h3>

<p>Akhnaton had left Thebes, as we have seen,
in about the eighth year of his reign; but his
mother, Queen Tiy, seems to have been unwilling
to accompany him, and to have decided to
remain in her palace at the foot of the Theban
hills. It is probable that she had not encouraged
her son to create the new capital, and the
removal of the court from Thebes must have
been something of a grief to her, though no
doubt she recognised the necessity of the step.
In spite of advancing years she must have sorely
missed the pomp and circumstance of the splendid
court over which she had once presided. Up
to the fourth year of her son’s reign she had
been dominant, and the whole known world
had bowed the knee to her. The luxuries of
the many kingdoms over which she held sway
had been hers to enjoy; but now, with the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and the nobles gone to the City of the Horizon,
and every penny which could be collected gone
with them, the old queen must have been obliged
to live a quiet, retired life in a palace which
was probably falling into rapid ruin. Her little
daughter, Baketaton, appears to have lived with
her; and it may be that some of her other
daughters were still with her, though of them
we hear nothing, and it is more probable that
they had already died. It seems likely that
she paid occasional state visits to her son, and
permanent accommodation was provided for her
in the City of the Horizon should she at any
time desire to stay there. Her major-domo, an
elderly man named Huya, appears to have lived
for part of the year at the new capital, where a
tomb was made for him; and it is from the
reliefs on the walls of this tomb that we obtain
the knowledge of one of these state visits made
by the old queen to Akhnaton. There is no evidence
to show in what year the visit which forms
the subject of the representations was made;
but as the twelfth year of Akhnaton’s reign is
mentioned in this tomb, it is probable that the
visit took place somewhere about that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The queen must now have been between fifty
and sixty years of age,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and her daughter
Baketaton, born just before the death of her
husband, was probably not much more than
twelve years old. Akhnaton received his mother
and sister with apparent joy and festivity, and
the major-domo, Huya, was called upon to
organise many a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> in their honour. Some of
them are shown in the reliefs, where even the
conventionalities of the artist have not been
able to hide from us the luxury of the scene.
One sees Akhnaton, his wife Nefertiti, his mother
Tiy, his sister Baketaton, and his two daughters
Merytaton and Ankhsenpaaton, seated together
on comfortable cushioned chairs, their feet resting
on <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'elaborate footsools'">elaborate footstools</ins>. Akhnaton is clad
in a skirt of clinging linen, but the upper part
of his body seems to have been bare. On his
forehead there gleams a small golden serpent,
and on his feet there are elaborate sandals; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
with customary simplicity he wears no jewellery.
Queen Nefertiti wears a flowing robe of fine
linen, and on her forehead also there is the
royal serpent. Queen Tiy wears the elaborate
wig which was in vogue during the days of the
old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, and upon it there rests an ornamental
crown consisting of a disk, two horns, two tall
plumes, and two small serpents, probably all
wrought in gold. A graceful robe of some
almost transparent material falls lightly over
her figure. The little girls appear to be naked.</p>

<p>Around this happy family group there stand
graceful tables upon which food of all kinds is
heaped. Here are joints of meat, dishes of confectionery,
vegetables, fruit,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> bread, cakes of
various kinds, and so on. The tables are
massed with lotus-flowers, according to the
charming custom of the ancient Egyptians of
all periods. Beside the tables stand jars of
wine and other drinkables, festooned with ribbons.
At the moment selected by the artist for reproduction,
Akhnaton is seen placing his teeth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the neatly trimmed meat adhering to a large
bone which he holds in his hand. To this day
it is the custom in Egypt thus to eat with the
hands. Nefertiti has a small roast duck in her
hands at which she daintily nibbles. Tiy’s morsel
cannot now be seen, but as she places it to her
mouth with one hand she presents a portion to
her daughter, Baketaton, with the other. The
two little princesses feed by Nefertiti’s side,
and appear to be sharing the meal. Meanwhile
Huya hurries to and fro superintending the
banquet, carefully tasting each dish before it
is presented to the royal party. Two string
bands play alternately, the one Egyptian and
the other apparently Syrian. The former consists
of four female performers, the first playing
on a harp, the second and third on lutes, and
the fourth on a lyre. The main instrument in
the foreign band is a large standing lyre, about
six feet in height, having eight strings, and
being played with both hands. Courtiers clad
in elaborate dresses, and holding ostrich-plume
standards, are grouped around the hall in which
the banquet takes place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Another set of reliefs in the tomb of Huya
shows us an evening entertainment in honour of
Queen Tiy. Again the same members of the
royal family are represented, but against the
cool night air more clothes are worn by each
person, and the upper part of the king’s body
is now seen to be covered by a mantle of soft
linen. The king, queen, and queen-dowager are
all shown drinking from delicate bowls, probably
made of gold. This being an evening festival,
little solid food appears to have been eaten,
but there are three flower-decked tables piled
high with fruit. From these the little princesses,
now wearing light garments, help themselves
liberally; and the small Ankhsenpaaton
stands upon the footstool of her mother’s chair,
holding on to her skirts with one hand, while
with the other she crams an apricot or some
similar fruit into her mouth. Two string bands
make music as before, and again the groups of
courtiers stand about the hall; while Huya
hastens to and fro directing the waiters, who,
with napkins thrown over their arms, replenish
the drinking-bowls from the wine-jars. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
hall is lit by several flaming lamps set upon
tall stands, near each of which these jars have
been placed.</p>


<h3>8. TIY VISITS HER TEMPLE.</h3>

<p>One more scene from this state visit is shown.
Here we observe Akhnaton leading his mother
affectionately by the hand to a temple which
had been built in her honour, as her private
place of worship, and which was called the
“Shade of the Sun.” This temple appears to
have been a building of great beauty and considerable
size. One passed through two great
swinging doors fixed between the usual two pylons,
and so entered the main court, which stood
open to the sunlight. A pillared gallery passed
along either side of this court, and between each
of the columns there stood statues of Akhnaton,
Amonhotep III., and Queen Tiy. In the middle
of the court rose the altar, to which one mounted
by a flight of low steps. At the far end of the
court another set of pylons and swinging doors
led into the inner chambers. Passing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
these doors one entered a small gallery, on either
side of which there were again statues of the
Pharaoh and his mother. Beyond stood the
sanctuary, closed by swinging doors; and inside
this was the second altar, flanked by statues
of the king and queen-dowager. To right and
left of the sanctuary there were small chapels;
and a passage led round behind the sanctuary
to the usual shrines, where more royal statues
were to be seen.</p>

<p>The building seems to have been brilliant
with colours; and on this particular occasion the
altars were heaped up with offerings. Great jars
of wine, decked with garlands of flowers and
ribbons, stood in the shadow of the colonnades;
and meat, bread, fruit, and vegetables were piled
on delicate stands, ornamented with flowers.</p>

<p>Akhnaton and Tiy were accompanied by the
little Princess Baketaton, Akhnaton’s sister, and
her two ladies-in-waiting. Before them walked
the queen’s major-domo, Huya, accompanied by
a foreign official wearing what appears to be
Cretan costume.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Behind them walked a noble
group of courtiers bearing ostrich-plume fans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and standards; and outside the temple precincts
waited a crowd of policemen, servants, charioteers
and grooms in charge of the royal chariots, fan-bearers,
porters, and temple attendants. These
people shout and cheer loyally as the royal party
arrives. “The ruler of the Aton!” they cry.
“He shall exist for ever and ever!” “She who
rises in beauty!” “To him on whom the Aton
rises!” “She who is patron of this temple of
Aton!” The old queen must have felt as though
she were back once more in the days of her
glory; and yet how different the simplicity of
the religious ceremonies to those of the old
priests of Amon-Ra. There was now but a
prayer or two at the altar, a little burning of
incense, a little bowing of the head, and then
the procession back to the palace, and the silent
closing of the holy gates.</p>


<h3>9. THE DEATH OF QUEEN TIY.</h3>

<p>It is possible that Queen Tiy took up her
residence at the City of the Horizon in recognition
of the lavish arrangements which her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had made for her. But whether this is so or
not, it does not seem that she lived very long
to enjoy such renewals of the pomps which she
had known in her younger days. Her death
appears to have taken place shortly after these
celebrations, and, probably by her express commands,
she was embalmed at Thebes and carried
from her palace up the winding valley to the
royal burying-ground amongst the rugged Theban
hills. Akhnaton showed his affection for her by
presenting the furniture for the tomb, and in
the inscriptions on the outer coffin one reads
that “he made it for his mother.” The queen-dowager
had evidently expressed a wish to be
buried near her father and mother, Yuaa and
Tuau; for the tomb, which is situated on the
east side of the valley, is within a stone’s-throw
of the sepulchre where they lay. It was entered
by a steep flight of steps leading down to a
sloping passage, at the end of which was the
large burial chamber, the walls of which were
carefully whitewashed. On passing into this
chamber a great box-like shrine, or outer coffin,
was to be found, occupying the greater part of
the room. The door to the shrine was made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
costly cedar of Lebanon covered with gold, and
was fitted with an ornamental bolt. Many of
the nails which held the woodwork together
were made of pure gold,&mdash;a fact which plainly
shows us the wealth of the royal treasuries at
this time. Scenes were embossed on the panels
showing the queen standing under the rays of
the Aton. The shrine itself was also made of
cedar, covered with gold, and on all sides were
scenes of the Aton worship. Here Akhnaton
was shown with Tiy, and the life-giving rays of
the sun streamed around their naturally drawn
figures. Inside this outer box the coffin containing
the great queen’s mummy was laid. The
usual funeral furniture was placed at the sides
of the room: gaily coloured boxes, alabaster
vases, faience toilet-pots, statuettes, &amp;c. Some
of the toilet utensils were made in the form of
little figures of the grotesque god Bes, which
indicates that Akhnaton still tolerated the recognition
by other persons of some of the old
gods. In the inscriptions upon the outer coffin
he had been careful to call his father, Amonhotep
III., by his second name, Nebmaara, as
often as possible, in order to avoid the writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the word Amon, his dislike of everything to
do with that god being profound. He allowed
it to be written, however, here and there, as it
seemed right to him that it should appear.
Akhnaton’s prejudice against the old state god
is also shown in another manner. Amon’s consort
was the goddess Mut “the Mother,” whose
name is written in hieroglyphs by a sign representing
a vulture. Now when the inscription
mentioned the king’s <em>mother</em>, Tiy, the word <em>mut</em>,
“mother,” had to be written; but in order to
avoid a similarity&mdash;even in spelling&mdash;to the
name of the goddess, Akhnaton had the word
written out phonetically, letter by letter, and
thus dispensed with the use of the vulture sign.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Again, in the name Nebmaara, the meaning of
which is “Ra, Lord of Truth,” the sign <em>maa</em>,
“truth,” represented the goddess of that name.
Akhnaton’s religion was much concerned with
the quality of truth, which he regarded as one
of the greatest necessities to happiness and well-being;
and the fallacy of supposing that there
was an actual deity of truth was particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
apparent to him. He was, therefore, careful to
write the sign <em>maa</em> in letters instead of with
the hieroglyph of the goddess.</p>

<p>When the funeral ceremonies came to an end,
when the last prayer was said and the last
cloud of incense had floated to the roof, the
golden door of the shrine was shut and bolted,
the outer doorways were walled up, and an
avalanche of stones, let down from the chippings
heaped near by, obliterated all traces of the
entrance. Thus Akhnaton paid his last tribute
to his mother and to the originator, it may be,
of the schemes which he had carried into effect;
and his last link with the past was severed.
With the death of this good woman a restraining
influence, as kindly as it was powerful, slipped
from his arm, and a new and fiercer chapter of
his short life began.</p>

THE THIRTEENTH TO THE FIFTEENTH
YEARS OF THE REIGN OF AKHNATON.</h2>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“The episode of the retirement of the king with his whole court to the
new palace and city, ... and the strange life of religious and artistic
propaganda which he led there, ... is one of the most curious and interesting
in the history of the world.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Budge</span>: ‘History of Egypt.’</p></div>

<hr class="r20" />

<h3>1. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RELIGION
OF ATON.</h3>


<p class="noindent">In the Pharaoh’s hymn to the Aton we read
these words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Thou didst create the earth according to Thy desire, ...</p>
<p class="verse0">The countries of Syria and Nubia,</p>
<p class="verse0">The land of Egypt....”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">It is certainly worthy of note that Syria and
Nubia are thus named before Egypt, and seem
to take precedence in Akhnaton’s mind. In the
same hymn the following lines occur:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“The Nile in heaven is for the strangers, ...</p>
<p class="verse0">But the Nile [itself,] it cometh from the nether world for Egypt.”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Here Akhnaton refers to the rain which falls
in Syria to water the lands of the stranger,
and compares it with the river which irrigates his
own country. Thus again his thoughts are first
for Syria and then for Egypt. This is the true
imperial spirit: in the broadness of the Pharaoh’s
mind his foreign possessions claim as much
attention as do his own dominions, and demand
as much love. The sentiments are entirely
opposed to those of the earlier kings of this
dynasty, who ground down the land of the
“miserable” foreigner and extracted therefrom
all its riches, without regard to aught else.</p>

<p>Akhnaton believed that his God was the Father
of all mankind, and that the Syrian and the
Nubian were as much under His protection as
the Egyptian. This is a greater advance in
ethics than may be at once apparent; for the
Aton thus becomes the first deity who was not
tribal or not national ever conceived by mortal
mind. This is the Christian’s understanding
of God, though not the Hebrew conception of
Jehovah. This is the spirit which sends the
missionary to the uttermost parts of the earth;
and it was such an attitude of mind which now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
led Akhnaton to build a temple for the Aton
in the heart of Syria, and another far up in
the Sudan.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The site of the Syrian temple is
now lost, but the Nubian buildings were recently
discovered and seem to have been of considerable
extent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_190_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="captionx">
<em>An Example of the Friendly Relations between Syria and Egypt.</em><br />
<br />
<p>A Syrian Soldier named Terura, and his wife, Aariburæ, attended by an Egyptian servant,
who assists him to hold the tube through which he is drinking wine from a jar. From a tablet
found at El Amarna. (Zeit. Aeg. Spr. xxxvi. 126.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the same time temples were being erected
in various parts of Egypt. At Hermonthis a
temple named “Horizon of Aton in Hermonthis”
was built; at Heliopolis there was a temple
named “Exaltation of Ra in Heliopolis,” and
also a palace for the king; at Hermopolis and
at Memphis temples were erected; and in the
Fayum and the Delta “Houses” of Aton sprang
up. Few real converts, however, seem to have
been made; for the religion was far above the
understanding of the people. In deference to
the king’s wishes the Aton was accepted, but
no love was shown for the new form of worship;
and, indeed, not even in the City of the Horizon
itself was it understood.</p>

<p>A certain change was now made by Akhnaton
in the name of the Aton. The words “Heat
which is in Aton” did not seem to him to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
very happily chosen. They had been used in
the earliest years of the movement, and had
evidently not been coined by Akhnaton himself.
The word “heat” was in spelling very reminiscent
of the name of one of the old gods, and,
to the uninitiate, might suggest some connection.
The name of the Aton was therefore
changed to “Effulgence which comes from
Aton,” the new words introducing into the spelling
the hieroglyph of Ra, the sun. The exact
significance of the alteration is not known; but
one may suppose that the new words better
conveyed the meaning which Akhnaton wished to
imply. Even now it is not easy to find a phrase
to express that vital energy, that first cause
of life, which the king so clearly understood.</p>

<p>The date of this change is somewhat uncertain,
though it is definitely to be placed between the
tenth and thirteenth year of the reign, the
probability being that it took place at the end
of the twelfth year, when Akhnaton was about
twenty-three years old. The inscriptions upon
the outer coffin, or shrine, of Queen Tiy show
the older form of wording, and the change,
therefore, took place after her death. Now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
queen did not die till the middle or end of the
twelfth year, for in the tomb of Huya events
of that year are recorded,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and he still holds
the office of steward to the queen, while a
letter from Dushratta, mentioning Tiy, was
docketed in the twelfth year. On the other
hand, the new name of the Aton occurs in
tombs which, by the number of Akhnaton’s
daughters represented in them, might be thought
to have been constructed earlier than this.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Thus there is a slight discrepancy; but the
point of significance is that the change occurred
after the queen’s death, and was thus concurrent
with another change which must here be
recorded.</p>


<h3>2. AKHNATON OBLITERATES THE NAME OF AMON.</h3>

<p>Up till this time it will have been observed
that Akhnaton had behaved with great leniency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
towards the worshippers of the older gods, and
had not even persecuted the priesthood of Amon-Ra.
It now becomes apparent that this restraint
was due to his mother’s influence, for no sooner
was she dead than Akhnaton turned with the
fierceness of a fanatic upon the latter institution.
He issued an order that the name of Amon was
to be erased wherever it occurred, and this order
was carried out with such amazing thoroughness
that hardly a single occurrence of the
name was overlooked. Although thousands of
inscriptions, accessible to Akhnaton’s agents, are
now known in which the name of Amon
occurs, there are but a few examples in which
the god’s name has not been mutilated. His
agents hammered the name out on the walls
of the temples throughout Egypt; they penetrated
into the tombs of the dead to erase it
from the texts; they searched through the
minute inscriptions upon small statuettes and
figures, obliterating the name therefrom; they
made journeys into the distant deserts to cut
out the name from the rock-scribbles of travellers;
they clambered over the cliffs beside the
Nile to erase it from the graffiti; they entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
private houses to rub it from small utensils
where it chanced to be inscribed.</p>

<p>Akhnaton was always thorough in his undertakings,
and half-measures were unknown to
him. When it came to the question of his own
father’s name, he seems not to have hesitated
to order the obliteration of the word Amon in
it, though one may suppose that in most cases
he painted over it the king’s second name,
Nebmaara. His agents burst their way into
the tomb of Queen Tiy and removed the name
Amonhotep from the inscriptions upon the shrine,
writing Nebmaara in red ink over each erasure.
Having scratched out the name even upon one
of the queen’s toilet-pots of minute size they
retired from the tomb, building up the wall at
the entrance, and continued their labours elsewhere.
The king was now asked whether his
own name, Amonhotep,&mdash;which had been used
before he adopted the better known Akhnaton,&mdash;was
to suffer the same fate, and the answer
seems to have been in the affirmative. Upon
the quarry tablet at Gebel Silsileh<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> the king’s
discarded name is thus erased, though it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
not damaged in the tomb of Rames. The names
of the various nobles and officials, male and
female, which were compounded with Amon&mdash;Amonhotep,
Setamon, Amonemhat, Amonemapt,
and so on&mdash;were ruthlessly destroyed; while
living persons bearing such names were often
obliged to change them.</p>

<p>In thus mutilating his father’s name Akhnaton
did not in any way intend to disparage his
forbears. He was but desirous of utterly obliterating
Amon from the memory of man, in
order that the true God might the better receive
acceptance. He was proud of his descent,
and, unlike most of his ancestors, he showed a
desire to honour the memory of his father. We
have seen<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> how one of his artists, Bek, represented
the figure of Amonhotep III. upon
his monument at Aswan. Huya, Queen Tiy’s
steward, was authorised by Akhnaton to show
that king upon the walls of his tomb;<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and in
the private temple of Queen Tiy, it will be remembered
that there were statues of Amonhotep III.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Likewise, the earlier kings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
dynasty received unusual recognition. An official
named Any held the office of Steward of the
House of Amonhotep II.;<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and there is a representation
of Akhnaton offering to Aton in “the
House of Thothmes IV. in the City of the Horizon.”<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Upon his boundary tablet Akhnaton
refers to Amonhotep III. and Thothmes IV. as
being troubled by the priesthood of Amon.</p>

<p>It would seem from the above that there were
shrines dedicated to Akhnaton’s ancestors in the
City of the Horizon, each of which had its
steward and its officials; and it is probable
that Akhnaton arranged that a memorial shrine
of the same kind should be erected for himself
against his death, for we read of a personage
who was “Second Priest” of the king.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> It was
his desire in this manner to show the continuity
of his descent from the Pharaohs of the elder
days, and to demonstrate his real claim to that
title “Son of the Sun” which had been held
by the sovereigns of Egypt ever since the Fifth
Dynasty, and which was of such vital import<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>ance
in the new religion. It was in this manner
that he claimed descent from Ra, who was to
him the same with Aton; and just as the great
religious teachers of the Hebrews made careful
note of their genealogies in order to prove themselves
descended from Adam, and hence in a
manner from God, so Akhnaton thus demonstrated
the continuity of his line in order to
show his real right to the titles “Child of Aton”
and “Son of the Sun.”</p>


<h3>3. THE GREAT TEMPLE OF ATON.</h3>

<p>The City of the Horizon of Aton must now
have been a very city of temples. There were
these shrines dedicated to the king’s ancestors;
there was the temple of Queen Tiy; there was
a shrine for the use of Baketaton, the king’s
sister; there was the “House of putting the
Aton to Rest,” where Queen Nefertiti officiated;
and there was the great temple of Aton, in which
probably were included other of the buildings
named in the inscriptions. The great temple
may here be briefly described, as the reader has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
so far made the acquaintance only of the building
belonging to Queen Tiy.</p>

<p>The temple was entirely surrounded by a
high wall, and in this respect was not unlike
the existing temple of Edfu, which the visitor
to Egypt will assuredly have seen. Inside the
area thus enclosed there were two buildings,
the one behind the other, standing clear of the
walls, thus leaving a wide ambulatory around
them. Upon passing through the gates of the
enclosing wall there was seen before one the
façade of the first of the two temples, while to
right and left there stood a small lodge or
vestry. The façade of the temple was most
imposing. Two great pylons towered up before
one, rising from behind a pillared portico, and
between them stood the gateway with its swinging
doors. Up the face of each pylon shot five
tall masts, piercing the blue sky above, and
from the heads of each there fluttered a crimson
pennant. Passing through the gateway one
entered an open court, in the midst of which
stood the high altar, up to which a flight of
steps ascended. On either side of this sun-bathed
enclosure stood a series of small chapels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
or chambers; while in front of one, in the axial
line, there was another gateway leading on into
the second court, from which one passed again
into a third court. Passing through yet another
gateway, a fourth division of the temple was
reached, this being a pillared gallery or colonnade
where one might rest for a while in the
cool shadow. Then onwards through another
gateway into the fifth court, crossing which one
entered the sixth court, where stood another altar
in the full sunshine. A series of some twenty
little chambers passed around the sides of this
court, and looking into the darkness beyond each
of their doorways one might discern the simple
tables and stands with which the rooms were
furnished. A final gateway now led one into
the seventh and last court, where again there
was an altar, and again a series of chambers
surrounded the open space.</p>

<p>Behind this main temple, and quite separate
from it though standing within the one enclosure,
stood the lesser temple, which was probably the
more sacred of the two. It was fronted by a
pillared portico, and before each column stood
a statue of Akhnaton, beside which was a smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
figure of his wife or one of his daughters.
Passing through the gateway, which was so
designed that nothing beyond could be seen, one
entered an open court in which stood the altar,
and around the sides of which were small chambers.
Here the temple ended, save for a few chambers
of uncertain use, approached from the ambulatory.</p>

<p>Both buildings were gay with colours, and at
festivals there were numerous stands heaped high
with flowers and other offerings, while red ribbons
added their notes of brilliant colour on all sides.
There was nothing gloomy or sombre in this
temple of Aton; and it contrasts strikingly with
the buildings in which Amon was worshipped.
There vast halls were lit by minute windows, and
a dim uncertainty hovered around the worshipper.
Such temples lent themselves to mystery,
and amidst their gloomy shadows many a supplicant’s
heart beat in terror. Dark stairways led
to subterranean passages, and these passages to
black chambers built in the thickness of the
wall, from whence the hollow voice of the priest
throbbed as from mid-air upon the ears of the
crouching congregation. But in Akhnaton’s temple
each court was open to the full blaze of the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>light.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
There was, there could be, no mystery;
nor could there be any terror of darkness to
loosen the knees of the worshipper. Akhnaton,
true scientist that he was, had no sympathy for
the occult and no interest in spiritualism. Boldly
he looked to God as a child to its father; and
having solved what he deemed to be the riddle
of life, there was no place in his mind for aught
but an open, fearless adoration of the Creator
of that vital energy which he saw in all things.
Akhnaton was the sworn enemy of the table-turners
of his day, and the tricks of priestcraft,
the stage effects of religiosity, were anathema
to his pure mind.</p>


<h3>4. THE BEAUTY OF THE CITY.</h3>

<p>The City of the Horizon of Aton was now a
place of surpassing beauty. Eight or nine years
of lavish expenditure in money and skill had
transformed the fields and the wilderness into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
as fair a city as the world had ever seen.
One of the nobles who lived there, by name
May, describes it in these words: “The mighty
City of the Horizon of Aton, great in loveliness,
mistress of pleasant ceremonies, rich in possessions,
the offering of the sun being in her midst.
At the sight of her beauty there is rejoicing.
She is lovely and beautiful: when one sees her
it is like a glimpse of heaven.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_202_fp.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Carved Wooden Chair, the designs partly covered with gold-leaf.</em></div>
</div>

<p>There was almost constant music in her streets,
and the scent of flowers was wafted upon every
breeze. Besides the temples and public buildings
the city was adorned with numerous palaces,
each standing in fair gardens. One of these
mansions,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> represented in the tomb of Meryra,
seems to have constituted a happy combination
of comfort and simplicity, as may be seen from
its pictures. One entered a walled court, and
so passed to the main entrance of the house.
A portico, the roof of which was supported by
four decorative columns festooned with ribbons,
sheltered the elaborate doorway from the sunshine.
Passing through this doorway, from the
top of which a row of cobras gleamed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
upon one, a pillared hall was reached; and beyond
this the visitor entered the great dining-hall.
Twelve columns supported the ceiling,
which was probably painted with flights of
birds; and under a kind of kiosk in the middle
of the hall stood the dining-table and several comfortable
arm-chairs, cushioned in bright colours.
Beyond this hall there was a court, at the back
of which were several chambers, one being a
bedroom, as a great cushioned bedstead clearly
shows. The owner’s womenfolk probably occupied
another portion of the building not shown
in the representations.</p>

<p>The palace of Ay, Akhnaton’s father-in-law,
was a more pretentious building. It was entered
by a fine doorway which led into a court. A
second door gave entrance to the large, pillared
dining-hall, and through this one passed into a
court from which bedrooms and boudoirs led off.
In one of these rooms two women, clad in airy
garments, are seen to be dancing with one
another, while a man plays a harp. In another
room a girl likewise dances to the strains of a
harp, while a servant dresses the hair of one of
the gentlemen of the household. Other rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
contain lutes, harps, and lyres, as well as objects
of the toilet. A little court is now reached,
where fragrant flowers grow, and tanks of water,
sunk in the decorated pavement, give a sense of
coolness to the air. Beyond this are more apartments,
and finally the kitchens are reached.
Throughout the house stand delicate tables upon
which jars of wine or dishes of fruit are to be
seen; and cushioned arm-chairs, with footstools
before them, are ready for the weary. Servants
are seen passing to and fro bearing refreshments,
or stopping to dust the floor, or again
idly talking in the passages.</p>

<p>Akhnaton’s palace is not very clearly shown
in the tomb reliefs or paintings, but portions
of it were found in the modern excavations on
the site<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. Like all the residential buildings of
the period, it was an airy and light structure
made of brick. The walls, ceilings, and floors
were covered with the most beautiful paintings;
and delicate pillars, inlaid with coloured glass
and stone, or covered with realistically painted
vines and creepers, supported <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the light rooves'">the light roofs</ins>
of its halls. Portions of the pavement are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
preserved, and the visitor to the site of the
city may still see the paintings there depicted.
A young calf, frisking in the sunlight, gallops
through a field of red poppies; wild geese rise
from the marshes and beat their way through
the reeds, disturbing the butterflies as they do
so; amidst the lotus-flowers resting upon the
rippling water the sinuous fish are seen to
wander. These are but fragments of the paintings
which once delighted the eyes of the
Pharaoh, or brought a sigh to the lips of his
queen.</p>

<p>The art of the painter of this period excels in
the depiction of animal and plant life. The
winding, tangled stems and leaves of vines
were carefully studied; the rapid motions of
animals were correctly caught; and it has been
said that in these things the artists of Akhnaton
were greater than those in any other Oriental
art<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. Sculpture in the round, too, reached a
pitch of excellence never before known. The
statue of Akhnaton illustrated opposite is the
work of one who may rank with Donatello, if
not with Cellini.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_206_fp.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Akhnaton.</em><br />
<span class="fs80">(From a statuette in the Louvre.)</span></div>
</div>

<p>It is possible that Auta, the chief sculptor
of Queen Tiy,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> is the creator of this statue, and
perhaps also of the head, probably, of Akhnaton’s
daughter shown opposite next page. In the tomb
of Huya there is a scene representing this artist
seated in his studio giving the final touches to
a statue of Princess Baketaton. He sits upon
a low stool, palette in hand, and, as was the
custom, colours the surface of the statue. Unlike
the stiff conventional poses of earlier work,
the attitude of the young girl is easy and
graceful. One hand hangs by her side: in the
other she holds a pomegranate, which she is
about to raise to her lips. Auta’s assistant
stands beside the figure, and near by two
apprentices work upon objects of less importance,
their chisels on a table by their side.</p>

<p>Works such as these which Auta and his
companions were turning out are permanent
memorials of the reign of Akhnaton, which will
carry his name through the years until, as he
would say, “the swan turns black and the crow
turns white.” There must surely come a time,
and soon, when the art of Egypt will receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
more attention; and one may then hear Akhnaton’s
name coupled with that of the Medici as
the patron, if not the teacher, of great masters.
It was he who released them from convention,
and bade their hands repeat what their eyes
saw; and it was he who directed those eyes to
the beauties of nature around them. He, and
no other, taught them to look at the world in
the spirit of life, to infuse into the cold stone
something of the “effulgence which comes from
Aton”; and, if these few treasures which have
survived the utter wreck of the City of the
Horizon have put one’s heart to a happy step,
it was Akhnaton who first set the measure.</p>


<h3>5. AKHNATON’S AFFECTION FOR HIS FAMILY.</h3>

<p>In about the thirteenth year of the reign a fifth
daughter was born, who was named Neferneferura.
This seems to have been the first daughter born
after the changes in the religion recorded at
the beginning of this chapter<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> had taken place;
and it is significant that the name of Aton, of
which all the previous daughters’ names had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
been compounded, now gives place to Ra. A
sixth daughter seems to have made her appearance
somewhat over a year later, some time
during the fourteenth year of the reign. Again
Ra is used in the name instead of Aton, she
being called Setepenra. It is impossible to say
what was the meaning of this slight change in
the theological aspect of the religion at this
period, but it seems evident that certain developments
in which Ra figured were now
introduced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_208_fp.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Head of Akhnaton’s Daughter.</em></div>
</div>

<p>No son was yet forthcoming, and both the
king and the queen must now have suffered
six successive disappointments. It may be
mentioned here that the next child born to
the unfortunate couple in the following year
proved to be a seventh girl and a seventh disappointment;
and in the remaining two years
of the reign no other child was born, or at
any rate was weaned, so that Akhnaton died
sonless. It is strange to picture this lofty-minded
preacher in his home, with his six little
girls around him, as he is shown upon the
monuments. No other Pharaoh thus portrayed
himself surrounded by his family; but Akhnaton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
seems to have never been happy unless all his
children were with him and his wife by his
side. The charm of family life, and the sanctity
of the relationship of husband and wife, parents
and children, seems to have been an important
point of doctrine to him. He urged his nobles,
also, to give their attention to their families;
and in the tomb of Panehesy, for example, one
may see representations of that personage sitting
with his wife and his three daughters around
him.</p>

<p>Akhnaton’s affection for his daughters is now
shown to us in another manner. When Amonhotep III.
had asked the King of Mitanni for
one of his daughters to be given in marriage to
Akhnaton, the little Nefertiti was at once
dispatched, although she was not yet old
enough to cohabit with her husband. He had
no scruples about sending the child of eight
years old to a foreign country, and seems to
have packed her off without a thought. Now,
however, we obtain a glimpse of Akhnaton’s
actions under similar circumstances, and the
difference is marked. The King of Babylon,
Burraburiash, wrote to Akhnaton in about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
fourteenth or fifteenth year of the reign, asking
for one of the Pharaoh’s daughters as a wife for
his son. Wishing to be on friendly terms with
Babylonia, Akhnaton consented to the union,
and selected probably his fourth daughter, Nefernefernaton,
as the future Queen of Babylon.
His eldest daughter subsequently married a
noble named Smenkhkara, who succeeded to the
throne after the death of Akhnaton; and his
third daughter was later married to another
noble named Tutankhaton, who usurped the
throne, as we shall see in the sequel. The fact
that neither of these daughters was now chosen
to marry the Babylonian prince indicates that
they were already betrothed to their future
husbands, and hence this event could not have
taken place much earlier than at the date
mentioned above. The second daughter, Meketaton,
was not selected for the reason that she
seems to have been in a precarious state of
health. The little princess who was chosen
was born in the tenth year of the reign, and
was now not more than five years of age.
Akhnaton, unlike the King of Mitanni, did not
at once send the child to her future home, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
arranged the marriage by proxy, and thus kept
his daughter with him for yet a few years. This
is made evident from the fact that in a letter
from Burraburiash to Akhnaton, the Babylonian
king states that he is sending a necklace
of over a thousand stones to the “Pharaoh’s
daughter, the wife of his son,” who is thus
evidently still resident in Egypt.</p>

<p>Besides Akhnaton’s six, and presently seven,
daughters there were two other princesses
probably in residence at the palace. One of
these, his young sister Baketaton, whom we
have seen visiting the City of the Horizon with
her mother, is not again heard of, and perhaps
did not long survive the dowager-queen’s death.
The other was Nezemmut, the sister of Queen
Nefertiti, who seems to have lived in Egypt
continuously since the time of the founding of
the new city, when we last saw her.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Her
portraits are shown in the tombs of May, Panehesy,
and Ay; and she is generally seen to be
accompanied by two female dwarfs, named Para
and Reneheh, who appear to have waddled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
after her wherever she went. She was still, no
doubt, very young, and these two grotesque
attendants were entrusted with her safety as
well as her amusement.</p>


<h3>6. AKHNATON’S FRIENDS.</h3>

<p>The simple and homely manner in which
Akhnaton is represented by his artists, surrounded
by his children, is an indication that
although he demanded much homage from his
subjects in his capacity as their Pharaoh, he but
asked for their sympathy and affection in all
other connections. As Pharaoh his person was
inapproachable and his attitude aloof, but as a
man he never failed to set an example of what
he considered a man should do; and even upon
his throne, to which one might but advance
with bowed head and bended knee, he displayed
his mortal nature to all beholders by joking with
his children or paying fond attention to his
wife. So, also, many of his disciples and courtiers,
who so ceremoniously approached the steps
of his throne, were in reality his good friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and intimates. Akhnaton did not care a snap
of the fingers for aristocratic traditions, and
although he demanded the conventional respect
of his subjects, and upheld the less tiresome
rules of court etiquette, many of his closest
friends were of peasant origin, and the hands
which now held the jewelled ostrich-plume standards
could as easily grasp the pick or the
plough.</p>

<p>May, a high official of the city, speaks of himself
in the following words: “I was a man of
low origin both on my father’s and on my mother’s
side, but the King established me.... He caused
me to grow ... by his bounty when I was a
man of no property; ... he gave me food and
provisions every day, I who had been one that
begged bread.” Huya, Queen Tiy’s steward,
speaks of the king as selecting his officials from
the ranks of the yeomen. Panehesy tells us
that Akhnaton is one “who maketh princes and
formeth the humble,” and he adds: “When I
knew not the companionship of princes I was
made an intimate of the King.” But if the
Pharaoh raised men from the ranks, he was also
capable of degrading those who offended against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the standards which he had set up. Thus May
seems to have been disgraced and turned out of
the city.</p>

<p>The tomb of the police official, Mahu, who
was a favourite of the king, though probably
not of exalted origin, has provided us with some
scenes relating to his official work which are of
considerable interest. In one series of these we
are shown the capture of some foreigners, or perhaps
Beduin, who may have belonged to some
gang of thieves or anarchists. Mahu has been
awakened in the early hours of a winter morning
by the news of the disturbance, and as he listens
to the report a servant blows a small fire into
flame, since the morning air is chilly. He then
sends for his chariot and drives to the scene of
the crime, whatever it may be; and soon he has
effected the arrest of some of the culprits.
These men are then conveyed to the Vizir, who,
with his staff, receives Mahu with exclamations
of approval. “Examine these men, O Princes,”
says the police officer, “whom the foreigners
have instigated.” From these words it might
seem that the prisoners were foreign spies, or even
assassins plotting against the life of the Pharaoh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether from fear of a revolt in Egypt or
from mere custom, the City of the Horizon was
closely defended at this time, and there is a
scene in this same tomb in which Akhnaton is
shown inspecting the fortifications. He drives
in his chariot with his wife and his eldest
daughter Merytaton; and although the spirited
horses would appear to be difficult to manage,
the more so because the mischievous Merytaton
is poking them with a stick, Akhnaton is a sufficiently
good driver to be able to carry on a conversation
with the queen, and to address a few
words to Mahu, who runs by the side of the
chariot. In striking contrast to the custom of
other Pharaohs, Akhnaton is accompanied by an
unarmed bodyguard of police as he drives round
the defences; and in this we may perhaps see
an indication of his popularity. The fortifications,
it may be noted, consist of blockhouses
built at regular intervals, and defended by wire
or rope entanglements.</p>

<p>In several of the tombs there are representations
of their owners receiving rewards from the
king for their diligence in their official works,
or for their intelligent acceptance of his teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>ing.
A high official named Pentu has left us a
scene in which Akhnaton is shown seated in the
hall of his palace, while Pentu stands before him
to receive numerous golden collars at the royal
hands in recognition of his services. A part of
the palace is shown, but the scene is much
damaged: a small pond or tank surrounded by
flowers is shown in one corner of the enclosure,
but the plan of the various rooms is confused,
and is quite subsidiary to the representation of
the hall where the Pharaoh receives the happy
Pentu. Akhnaton seems to have been a good
friend, as he was a stern enemy; and those who
assisted him in the difficult tasks which he had
set himself were lavishly rewarded for their
pains.</p>


<h3>7. AKHNATON’S TROUBLES.</h3>

<p>Akhnaton’s health was so very uncertain that
he hastened to construct for himself a tomb
in the cliffs behind the City of the Horizon.
He selected as the site of his last resting-place
a gaunt and rugged valley which here cuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
into the hills, leading back, around tumbled
rocks and up dry watercourses, to the Arabian
desert beyond. It is</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“A savage place!&mdash;as holy and enchanted</p>
<p class="verse0">As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted</p>
<p class="verse0">By woman wailing for her demon-lover.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Here Akhnaton elected to be buried, where
hyænas prowled and jackals wandered, and where
the desolate cry of the night-owls echoed over
the rocks. In winter, the cold wind sweeps
up this valley and howls around the rocks;
in summer the sun makes of it a veritable
furnace unendurable to man. There is nothing
here to remind one of the God who watches
over him, and the tender Aton of the Pharaoh’s
conception would seem to have abandoned this
place to the spirits of evil. There are no flowers
where Akhnaton cut his sepulchre, and no birds
sing; for the king believed that his soul, caught
up into the noon of Paradise, would need no
more the delights of earth.</p>

<p>The tomb consisted of a passage descending
into the hill, and leading to a rock-cut hall,
the roof of which was supported by four columns.
Here stood the sarcophagus of pink granite in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
which the Pharaoh’s mummy would lie. The
walls of this hall were covered with scenes
carved in plaster,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> representing various phases
of the Aton worship. From the passage there
led another small chamber beyond which a
further passage was cut, perhaps to lead to
a second hall in which the queen should be
buried; but the work was never finished.</p>

<p>The construction of the tomb was interrupted
by the death of Akhnaton’s second daughter,
Meketaton, who had barely lived to see her
ninth birthday. It has already been seen that
she seems to have been ailing for some time,
and her death was perhaps no surprise to her
parents. Their grief, however, was none the
less acute for this; and when the body of the
little girl had been laid to rest in one of the
chambers of her father’s tomb, the walls were
covered at Akhnaton’s order with scenes representing
the grief of the bereaved family.
Here Queen Nefertiti is seen holding in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
arms her lately born seventh daughter, whose
name, ending in ... t, is now lost; while the
five other little girls weep with their parents
beside the bier of their dead sister. It is a
pathetic picture, and one which stirs our sympathy
for a Pharaoh who, unlike all other kings
of Egypt, could weep for the loss of a daughter.</p>

<p>This was not Akhnaton’s only grief. His
doctrines were not being accepted in Egypt
as readily as he had hoped, and he was probably
able to detect a considerable amount of
insincerity in the attitude of those around him.
There was hardly a man whom he could trust
to continue in the faith should he himself die;
and even as he put the last touches to his
temples and his palaces he was aware that
he had built his house upon the sand. The
empire which he had dreamed of, bound together
by the ties of a common worship of Aton, was
fast fading out of sight, and the news which
reached him from Syria was disquieting in the
extreme.</p>

<p>At this time the King of Babylon, whose
son had married Akhnaton’s daughter, seems
to have been on bad terms with his neighbour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the King of Mitanni, the father of the Pharaoh’s
much-loved Queen Nefertiti; and Akhnaton came
nigh to being drawn into the quarrel. The
Babylonian king had been ill for some time,
and in the course of the international correspondence
Nefertiti had never once sent her
condolences to him, apparently because he was
a poor friend to her father. This was much
resented, and the King of Babylon at last
sent an insulting letter to Akhnaton, in which
he states that he is sending him the usual
present of decorative objects which etiquette
required of him, but that he wishes it to be
understood that only a fraction of the gift
is intended for the “mistress of his house,”
<em>i.e.</em>, Nefertiti, since she had not troubled to
ask after his health.</p>

<p>Shortly after this he wrote another letter
to Akhnaton making various complaints, and
stating that his messengers had been robbed
in territory belonging to the Pharaoh, who must
therefore make good their losses. A third letter
makes similar complaints, and hints at future
trouble. Meanwhile the King of Mitanni was
on none too friendly terms with Akhnaton, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
appears to have detained the Pharaoh’s envoy,
named Mani, thereby causing Akhnaton
considerable anxiety. There was, in fact, a general
tendency to disparage the Egyptian king, which
must have been exceedingly galling to Akhnaton,
who had the power to let loose upon Asia an
army which would silence all insult, but did
not find such a step consistent with his principles.
In a letter which he wrote to one of
the Syrian princes whose fidelity was doubtful,
Akhnaton ends his despatch with the words:
“I am very well, I the sun in the heavens,
and my chariots and soldiers are exceedingly
numerous; and from Upper Egypt even unto
Lower Egypt, and from the place where the
sun riseth even unto the place where he setteth,
the whole country is in good cause and content.”
Thus we see that Akhnaton knew his power,
and wished that others should know it; and
it is therefore the more surprising that, as we
shall presently find, he never chose to use it.</p>

<hr class="r20" />

<h3>1. THE HITTITE INVASION OF SYRIA.</h3>


<p class="noindent">The eastern end of the Mediterranean is bounded
on the south by Egypt and the desert, on the
east by Palestine and Syria, and on the north
by Asia Minor, these roughly forming the three
sides of a square. The conquests of the great
warrior-Pharaoh Thothmes III. had carried the
Egyptian power as far as the north-east corner
of this formation&mdash;that is to say, to the point
where Syria meets Asia Minor. The island of
Cyprus is in shape not unlike a hand with index
finger extended; and this finger may be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to be pointing to the limit of Egyptian conquest,
somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Amanus
Mountains. The kingdom of Mitanni, the home
of Queen Nefertiti, was situated on the banks
of the Euphrates some distance inland from
these mountains; and as it acted as a buffer
state between the Egyptian possessions in Syria
and the unconquered lands beyond, the Pharaohs
had taken care to unite themselves by marriage,
as we have seen, with its rulers. Behind Mitanni
to the north-east, the friendly kingdoms later
known as Assyria marked the limits of the
known world; while to the north the hostile
lands of Asia Minor lay in the possession of the
Hittites, a warlike confederacy of peoples, perhaps
the ancestors of the modern Armenians.
From these hardy warriors the greatest danger
to the Egyptian Empire in Syria was to be
expected; and the statesmen of Egypt must have
cast many an anxious look towards those forbidding
mountains which loomed beyond Mitanni.
A southern movement of the Hittites, indications
of which were already very apparent, would
bring them swarming over and around the
Amanus Mountains, either along the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and inland route through Mitanni, or along the
western route beside the sea and over the
Lebanon, or again, midway between these two
routes, past the great cities of Tunip, Kadesh,
and others, which stood to block the way.</p>

<p>When Akhnaton ascended the throne, Seplel
was king of the Hittites, and was by way of
being friendly to Egypt. Some of his people,
however, crossed the frontiers of Mitanni and
were repulsed by Dushratta, the king of that
country, who was father-in-law to Akhnaton.
This caused some coldness between Seplel and
the Pharaoh; and although the former sent an
embassy to the City of the Horizon, the correspondence
between the two monarchs presently
ceased. The young idealist of Egypt seems to
have held warfare in horror; and the Hittites
were so essentially a fighting race that Akhnaton
could have had no friendly feelings towards them.
Soon we find that these Hittites, unable to overflow
into the land of Mitanni, have moved along
the eastern route and have seized the land of
Amki, which lay on the sea-coast between the
Amanus Mountains and the Lebanon. This
movement might have been stopped by Aziru,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
an Amorite prince who ruled the territory between
Amki and Mitanni, and whose duty, as
an Egyptian vassal, was to check the southern
incursions of the Hittites. But Aziru, like his
father Abdashirta before him, was a man as
ambitious as he was faithless, and his dealings
both with the Hittites and with the Egyptians
during the following years were unscrupulous
in the extreme. It was his policy to play the
one nation against the other, and to extend
the scope of his own power at the expense of
both.</p>


<h3>2. AKHNATON’S CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTIONS
TO WARFARE.</h3>

<p>Akhnaton’s policy in Syria, when considered
from the point of view of an ordinary man, was
of the weakest. Ideals cannot govern an empire,
and those who would apply the doctrine of
“peace and goodwill” to subject races endanger
the very principles which they would teach.
While the young Pharaoh was singing his
imperial psalms to the Atom in his growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
capital, the princes of Syria were whistling the
revolutionary ditties which presently were to
ring in the ears of the isolated Egyptian garrisons.
Little did they care for that tender
Father of Mankind to whom Akhnaton’s thin
finger so earnestly pointed. They knew nothing
of monotheism; they found no satisfaction in
One who was the gentle ruler of all men without
distinction of race. A true god to them
was a vanquisher of other gods, a valiant leader
in battle, a relentless avenger of insult. The
furious Baal, the bloodthirsty Tishub, the terrible
Ishtar&mdash;these were the deities that a man
could love. How they scorned that God of
Peace who was called the Only One! How
they laughed at the young Pharaoh who
had set aside the sword for the psalter, who
hoped to rule his restless dominions by love
alone!</p>

<p>Love! One stands amazed at the reckless
idealism, the beautiful folly, of this Pharaoh
who, in an age of turbulence, preached a
religion of peace to seething Syria. Three
thousand years later mankind is still blindly
striving after these same ideals in vain. Nowadays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
one is familiar with the doctrine: a
greater than Akhnaton has preached it, and
has died for it. To-day God is known to us,
and the peace of God is a thing hoped for;
but at that far-off period, thirteen hundred
years before the birth of Christ, two or three
centuries before the age of David and Solomon,
and many a year before the preaching of Moses,
one is utterly surprised to behold the true light
shining forth for a short moment like the sun
through a rift in the clouds, and one knows
that it has come too soon. Mankind, even now
not ready, was then most wholly unprepared,
and the price which Egypt paid for the ideals
of her Pharaoh was no less than the complete
loss of her dominions.</p>

<p>Akhnaton believed in God, and to him that
belief meant a practical abhorrence of war.
Marshalling the material available for the study
of this period of history, one can interpret the
events in Syria in only one way: Akhnaton
definitely refused to do battle, believing that
a resort to arms was an offence to God.
Whether fortune or misfortune, gain or loss,
was to be his lot, he would hold to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
principles, and would not return to the old
gods of battle.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that at this time
the empire was the personal property of the
Pharaoh, as every kingdom was of its king.
Nobody ever considered a possession as belonging
to the nation which had laid hands upon it,
but only to that nation’s king. It mattered
very little to the Syrian peoples whether their
owner was an Egyptian or a Syrian, though
perhaps they preferred to be possessed by one
of their own race. Akhnaton was thus doing
his will with his own property. He was
refusing to fight for his own possessions; he
was acting literally upon the Christian principle
of giving the cloak to him who had stolen the
coat. Patriotism was a sentiment unknown to
the world: devotion to the king’s personal
interest was all that actuated loyalty in the
subject, and the monarch himself had but his
own interests to consider. Thus Akhnaton cannot
be accused of ruining his country by his
refusal to go to war. He was entitled to do
what he liked with his own personal property,
and if he sacrificed his possessions to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
principles, the sacrifice was made upon God’s
high altar, and the loss would be felt by him
alone. Such a loss, it is true, would probably
break his heart; for he loved Syria dearly, and
he had had such great hopes of uniting the
empire by the tie of a common religion. But
for good or ill, he was determined to stand
aloof from the struggles upon which Syria was
now entering.</p>


<h3>3. THE FAITHLESSNESS OF AZIRU.</h3>

<p>While Aziru, the Amorite, schemed on the
borders of Asia Minor, a Syrian prince named
Itakama suddenly set up an independent kingdom
at Kadesh and joined hands with the
Hittites, thus cutting off the loyal city of Tunip,
the friendly kingdom of Mitanni, and the territory
of the faithless Aziru from direct intercourse
with the Lebanon and Egypt’s remaining
possessions in Palestine and Syria. Three loyal
vassal kings, perhaps assisted by Dushratta of
Mitanni, attacked the rebels, but were repulsed
by Itakama and his Hittite allies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Aziru at once turned the situation to his own
advantage. Hemmed in between the Hittites
on the north and this new kingdom of Kadesh
on the south, he collected his armies and
marched down the Orontes to the Mediterranean
coast, capturing the cities near the mouth
of that river and adding them to his possessions.
Should the Hittites ask him to give an account
of these proceedings, he could reply that he was,
as it were, the advance-guard of the Hittite
invasion of Syria, and was preparing the road
for them. Should Itakama question him, he
could say that he was, with friendly hands,
linking the Hittites with Kadesh. And should
Akhnaton call upon him for an explanation, he
could answer that he was securing the land for
the Egyptians against the Hittite advance.</p>

<p>No doubt Aziru preferred to keep his peace
with the Hittites the most secure, for it was
obvious that they were the rising people; but
at the same time he did not yet dare to show
any hostility to Egypt, whose armies might at
any moment be launched across the Mediterranean.
Unable to hold a position of independence,
he now thought it most prudent to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the northmen to swarm southwards through his
dominions, from Amki over and around the
Lebanon to Kadesh, where their ally Itakama
dwelt. In return for this assistance he seems to
have been allowed a free hand in the forwarding
of his own interests, and we now find him turning
his attention to the sea-coast cities of Simyra
and Byblos, which nestled at the western foot
of the Lebanon. Here, however, he received a
check, and failed to obtain a footing. He therefore
marched eastwards to the city of Niy, which
he captured, slaying its king; and both to the
Hittites and to the Egyptians he seems to have
pretended that he had taken this step in their
interests.</p>

<p>On hearing of the fall of this city the
governor of Tunip wrote a pathetic appeal to
Akhnaton, asking for help; for he was now
quite isolated, and he knew that Aziru was a
free-lance who cared not a jot for any but his
own welfare.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the King of Egypt, my lord,” runs the
letter. “The inhabitants of Tunip, thy servant.
May it be well with thee, and at the feet of our
lord we fall. My lord, Tunip, thy servant, speaks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
saying: Who formerly could have plundered Tunip
without being plundered by Thothmes III.? The
gods ... of the King of Egypt, my lord, dwell in
Tunip. May our lord ask his old men [if it be
not so.] Now, however, we belong no more to
our lord, the King of Egypt.... If his soldiers
and chariots come too late, Aziru will make us
like the city of Niy. If, however, we have to
mourn, then the King of Egypt will mourn over
these things which Aziru has done, for he will
turn his hand against our lord. And when Aziru
enters Simyra Aziru will do to us as he pleases,
in the territory of our lord the King, and on
account of these things our lord will have to
lament. And now Tunip, thy city, weeps, and her
tears are flowing, and there is no help for us.
For twenty years we have been sending to our
lord the King, the King of Egypt, but there has
not come to us a word&mdash;no, not one.”</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Several points become apparent from this letter.
One sees that in the more distant cities of Syria
the significance of Akhnaton’s new religion was
not understood. The governor of Tunip refers
to the old gods of Egypt worshipped in that
town, and he knows not, or cannot be brought
to believe, that Akhnaton has become a monotheist.
One sees that the memory of the terrible
Thothmes III. and his victorious armies was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in men’s minds, and was probably one of the
main causes of the long-continued peace in Syria.
Akhnaton’s father, Amonhotep III., had not concerned
himself greatly with regard to his foreign
dominions, and, as the people of Tunip had been
asking for assistance for twenty years, it would
seem that the danger which now beset them
was already feared before that Pharaoh’s death.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_234_fp.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Letter from Ribaddi to the King of Egypt, reporting the progress
of the rebellion under Aziru.</em><br />
<span class="fs80">(British Museum, No. 29,801.)</span></div>
</div>

<p>How, one asks, could Akhnaton read such a
letter as this, and yet refuse to send a relieving
army to Syria? Byblos and Simyra were still
loyally holding out; and troops disembarked at
these ports could speedily be marched inland to
Tunip, could crush Hakama at Kadesh, and
could frighten Aziru into giving real assistance
to Dushratta and other loyal kings in holding
the Hittites back behind the Amanus Mountains.
But this was Akhnaton’s Gethsemane, if
one may say so with reverence; and like that
greater Teacher who, thirteen hundred years
later, was to preach the self-same doctrine of
personal sacrifice, one may suppose that the
Pharaoh suffered a very Agony as he realised
that his principles were leading him to the loss
of all his dearest possessions. His restless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
generals in Egypt, eager to march into Syria,
must have brought every argument to bear
upon him; but the boy would not now turn
back. “Put up thy sword into his place,” he
seems to have said; “for all they that take
the sword shall perish with the sword.”</p>


<h3>4. THE FIGHTING IN SYRIA BECOMES GENERAL.</h3>

<p>At this time the King of Byblos was one
named Ribaddi, a fine old soldier who was loyal
to Egypt in his every thought and deed. He
wrote to Akhnaton urging him to send troops
to relieve the garrison of Simyra, upon which
Aziru was again pressing close; for if Simyra
fell, he knew that Byblos could not for long
hold out. Presently we find that Zimrida, the
king of the neighbouring port of Sidon, has
opened his gates to Aziru, and has marched with
him against Tyre. Abimilki, the King of Tyre,
at once wrote to Akhnaton asking for assistance;
but on receiving no reply he, too, appears
to have thrown in his lot with Aziru. Ribaddi
was now quite isolated at Byblos; and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the beleaguered city he wrote to the Pharaoh telling
him that “Simyra is like a bird in a snare.”
Akhnaton made no reply; and in a short time
Ribaddi wrote again, saying, “Simyra, your
fortress, is now in the power of the Khabiri.”</p>

<p>These Khabiri were the Beduin from behind
Palestine, who were being used as mercenaries
by Aziru, and who themselves were making
small conquest in the south on their own
behalf. Thus the southern cities of Megiddo,
Askalon, Gezer, and others, write to the Pharaoh
asking for aid against them. Exasperated, however,
by Akhnaton’s inaction, Askalon and Gezer,
together with the city of Lachish, threw off <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Egptian yoke'">the
Egyptian yoke</ins> and attacked Jerusalem, which was
still loyal to Egypt, being held by an officer
named Abdkhiba. This loyal soldier at once
sent a despatch to Akhnaton, part of which
read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The King’s whole land, which has begun
hostilities with me, will be lost. Behold the
territory of Seir, as far as Carmel, its princes
are wholly lost; and hostility prevails against
me.... As long as ships were upon the sea
the strong arm of the King occupied Naharin
and Kash, but now the Khabiri are occupying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the King’s cities. There remains not one prince
to my lord, the King; every one is ruined....
Let the King take care of his land, and ... let
him send troops.... For if no troops come in
this year, the whole territory of my lord the King
will perish.... If there are no troops in this
year, let the King send his officer to fetch me
and my brothers, that we may die with our lord,
the King.</p></div>

<p>To this letter the writer added a postscript
addressed to Akhnaton’s secretary, with whom he
was evidently acquainted. “Bring these words
plainly before my lord the King,” runs this
pathetic appeal. “The whole land of my lord,
the King, is going to ruin.”</p>

<p>The letters sent to Akhnaton from the few
princes who remained loyal form a collection
which even now moves the reader. To Akhnaton
they must have been so many sword-thrusts, and
one may picture him praying passionately for
strength to set them aside. Soon it would seem
that the secretaries hardly troubled to show
them to him; and ultimately they were so effectually
pigeon-holed that they have only recently
been discovered. The Pharaoh permitted himself
to answer some of them, and seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
asked questions as to the state of affairs; but
never does he offer any encouragement. Lapaya,
one of the princes of the south, who had evidently
received a communication from Akhnaton
in which his fidelity was questioned, wrote saying
that if the Pharaoh ordered him to drive a
sword of bronze into his heart he would do so.
It is a commentary upon the veracity of the
Oriental that in subsequent letters this prince is
stated to have attacked Megiddo, and ultimately
to have been slain while fighting against the
Egyptian loyalists.</p>

<p>Addudaian, a king of some unknown city of
south Judea, acknowledges the receipt of a letter
from Akhnaton in which he was asked to remain
loyal; and he complains, in reply, of the loss of
various possessions. Dagantakala, the king of
another city, writes imploring the Pharaoh to
rescue him from the Khabiri. Ninur, a queen
of a part of Judea, who calls herself Akhnaton’s
handmaid, entreats the Pharaoh to save her,
and records the capture of one of her cities by
the Khabiri.</p>

<p>And so the letters run on, each telling of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
disaster to the Egyptian cause, and each voicing
the bitter complaint of those who were being
sacrificed to the principles of a king who had
grasped the meaning of civilisation too soon.</p>


<h3>5. AZIRU AND RIBADDI FIGHT TO A FINISH.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile Ribaddi was holding Byblos valiantly
against Aziru’s armies, and many were the
despatches which he sent to Akhnaton asking
for assistance against Aziru. Nothing could have
been easier than the despatch of a few hundred
men across the Mediterranean to the beleaguered
port, and the number which Ribaddi asks for is
absurdly small. Akhnaton, however, would not
send a single man, but instead wrote a letter
of gentle rebuke to Aziru, telling him to come to
the City of the Horizon to explain his conduct.
Aziru wrote at once to one of Akhnaton’s
courtiers who was his friend, telling him to
speak to the Pharaoh and to set matters right.</p>

<p>He explained that he could not leave Syria at
that time, for he must remain to defend Tunip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
against the Hittites. The reader, who has seen
the letter written by the governor of Tunip
asking for help against Aziru, will realise the
perfidy of this Amorite, who was now, no doubt,
preparing to capture Tunip for the sake of its
riches, and, having done so, would tell Akhnaton
that he had entered it to hold it against the
Hittites.</p>

<p>Akhnaton then wrote to Aziru insisting that
he should rebuild the city of Simyra, which he
had destroyed; but Aziru again replied that he
was too busy in defending Egyptian interests
against the inroads of the Hittites to give his
attention to this matter for at least a year. To
this Akhnaton sent a mild reply; but Aziru,
fearing that the letter might contain some
matter which it would be better for him not to
hear, contrived to evade the messenger, and the
despatch was brought back to Egypt. He wrote
to the Pharaoh, however, saying that he would
see to it that the cities captured by him
should continue to pay tribute as usual to
Egypt.</p>

<p>The tribute seems to have reached the City
of the Horizon in correct manner until the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
years of the reign,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> though probably it was much
less in quantity than had been customary. There
was general confusion in Syria, as we have seen;
but, as in the case of the struggle between Aziru
and Ribaddi, where both professed their loyalty
to Egypt, so, in all the chaos, there was a make-believe
fidelity to the Pharaoh. The tribute was
thus paid each year by a large number of cities,
and it was probably not till the seventeenth
and last year of Akhnaton’s reign that this
pretence of loyalty was altogether discarded.</p>

<p>In desperate straits at Byblos, Ribaddi made
a perilous journey to the neighbouring city of
Beyrût in order to attempt to collect reinforcements.
No sooner had he left, however, than
an insurrection occurred at Byblos, and Ribaddi
paid for his loyalty to Egypt by losing the
support of his own subjects. Presently Beyrût
surrendered to Aziru, and Ribaddi was forced to
fly. After many an adventure the stout old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
king managed to regain control of Byblos, and
to set about the further defence of the city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Aziru had paid a rapid visit to
Egypt, partly to justify his conduct and partly,
no doubt, to ascertain the condition of affairs
on the Nile. With Oriental cunning he managed
to satisfy Akhnaton that his intentions
were not hostile to Egypt, and so returned to
the Lebanon. Ribaddi, hearing of this, at once
sent his son to the City of the Horizon to expose
Aziru’s perfidy and to plead for assistance
against him. At the same time he wrote to
Akhnaton a pathetic account of his misfortunes.
Four members of his family had been taken
prisoners; his brother was constantly conspiring
against him; old age and disease pressed
heavily upon him. All his possessions had been
taken from him, all his lands devastated; he
had been reduced by famine and the privations
of a long siege to a state of utter destitution,
and he could not much longer hold out. “The
gods of Byblos,” he writes, “are angry with me
and sore displeased; for I have sinned against
the gods, and therefore I do not come before my
lord the King.” Was his sin, one wonders, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
adoption for a while of Akhnaton’s faith? To
this communication Akhnaton seems to have
made no reply.</p>


<h3>6. AKHNATON CONTINUES TO REFUSE TO
SEND HELP.</h3>

<p>The messengers who arrived at the City of
the Horizon of Aton, dusty and travel-stained,
to deliver the many letters asking for help,
must have despaired indeed when they observed
the manner in which the news was received.
Hateful to these hardy soldiers of the empire
were the fine quays at which their galleys
moored; hateful the fair villas and shaded
avenues of the city; and thrice hateful the
rolling hymns to the Aton which came to them
from the temple halls as they hurried to the
Pharaoh’s palace. The townspeople smiled at
their haste in this city of dreams; the court
officials delayed the delivery of their letters,
scoffing at the idea of urgency in the affairs of
Asia; and finally these wretched documents,
written&mdash;if ever letters were so written&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
blood and with tears, were pigeon-holed in the
city archives and utterly forgotten save by
Akhnaton himself. Instead of the brave music
of the drums and bugles of the relieving army
which these messengers had hoped to muster,
there rang in their maddened ears only the
ceaseless chants of the priestly ceremonies and
the pattering love-songs of private festivals.
Newly come from the sweat and the labour of
the road, their brains still racked with the
horror of war and yet burning with the vast
hopes of empire, they looked with scorn at
the luxury of Egypt’s new capital, and heard
with disgust the dainty tales of the flowers.
The lean, sad-eyed Pharaoh, with his crooked
head and his stooping shoulders, would speak
only of his God; and, clad in simple clothes
unrelieved by a single jewel, there was nothing
martial in his appearance to give them hope.
From the beleaguered cities which they had so
lately left there came to them the bitter cry
for succour; and it was not possible to drown
that cry in words of peace, nor in the jangle of
the systrum or the warbling of the pipes.
Who, thought the waiting messengers, could resist
that piteous call: “Thy city weeps, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
her tears are flowing”? Who could sit idle in
the City of the Horizon when the proud empire,
won with the blood of the noblest soldiers of
the great Thothmes, was breaking up before their
eyes? What mattered all the philosophies in
the world, and all the gods in heaven, when
Egypt’s great dominions were being wrested from
her? The splendid Lebanon, the white kingdoms
of the sea, Askalon and Ashdod, Tyre and Sidon,
Simyra and Byblos, the hills of Jerusalem, Kadesh
and the great Orontes, the fair Jordan, Tunip,
Aleppo, the distant Euphrates.... What counted
a creed against these? God? The truth? The
only god was He of the Battles, who had led
Egypt into Syria; the only truth the doctrine
of the sword, which had held her there for so
many years.</p>

<p>Looking back across these thirty-two centuries,
can one yet say whether the Pharaoh was in the
right, or whether his soldiers were the better
minded? On the one hand there is culture,
refinement, love, thought, prayer, goodwill, and
peace; on the other hand, power, might, health,
hardihood, bravery, and struggle. One knows
that Akhnaton’s theories were the more civilised,
the more ideal; but is there not a pulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
which stirs in sympathy with those who were
holding the citadels of Asia? We can give our
approval to the ideals of the young king, but
we cannot see his empire fall without bitterly
blaming him for the disaster. Yet in passing
judgment, in calling the boy to account for the
loss of Syria, there is the consciousness that
above our tribunal sits a judge to whom war
must assuredly be abhorrent, and in whose
eyes the struggle of the nations must utterly
lack its drama. Thus, even now, Akhnaton
eludes our criticism, and but raises once more
that eternal question which as yet has no
answer.</p>


<h3>7. AKHNATON’S HEALTH GIVES WAY.</h3>

<p>It is possible that the Pharaoh now realised
his position, and one may suppose that he tried
as best he could to pacify the turbulent princes
by all the arts of diplomacy. It does not seem,
however, that he yet fully appreciated the catastrophe
which was now almost inevitable&mdash;the
complete loss of Syria. He could not bring
himself to believe that the princes of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
country would play him false; and he could
have had no idea that he was being so entirely
fooled by such men as Aziru. But when at
last the tribute ceased to come in regularly, then,
too late, he knew that disaster was upon him.</p>

<p>The thoughts which now must have held sway
in his mind could not have failed to carry him
down the dark steps of depression to the very
pit of despair, and one may picture him daily
cast prone upon the floor before the high altar
of the Aton, and nightly tossing sleepless upon
his royal bed. It seems that he had placed
great reliance upon a certain official, named
Bikhuru, who was acting as Egyptian commissioner
in Palestine; but now it is probable
that he received news of that unfortunate personage’s
flight, and later of his murder.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Then
came the report that Byblos had fallen, and one
is led to suppose that that truly noble soldier
Ribaddi did not survive the fall of the city
which he had so tenaciously held. The news
of the surrender of other important Egyptian
strongholds followed rapidly, and still there
came the pathetic appeal for help from the
minor posts which yet held out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Akhnaton was now about twenty-eight years
of age, and already the cares of the whole world
seemed to rest upon his shoulders. Lean and
lank was his body; his face was thin and lined
with worry; and in his eye one might, perhaps,
have seen that hunted look which comes to those
who are dogged by disaster. It is probable that
he now suffered acutely from the distressing
malady to which he was a victim, and there
must have been times when he felt himself
upon the verge of madness. His misshapen
skull came nigh to bursting with the full
thoughts of his aching brain, and the sad knowledge
that he had failed must have pressed upon
his mind like some unrelenting finger. The
invocations to the Aton which rang in his head
made confusion with the cry of Syria. Now he
listened to the voices of his choirs lauding the
sweetness of life; and now, breaking in upon the
chant, did he not hear the solemn voices of his
fathers calling to him from the Hills of the West
to give account of his stewardship? Could he
then find solace in trees and in flowers? Could
he cry “Peace” when there was red tumult in
his brain?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>His moods at this time must have given cause
for the greatest alarm, and his behaviour was,
no doubt, sufficiently erratic to render even those
nobles who had so blindly followed him mistrustful
of their leader. In a frenzy of zeal in
the adoration of the Aton, Akhnaton now gave
orders that the name of all other gods should
suffer the same fate as that of Amon, and should
be erased from every inscription throughout
the land. This order was never fully carried
out; but one may still see in the temples of
Karnak, Medinet Habu, and elsewhere, and upon
many lesser monuments, the chisel marks which
have partially blurred out the names of Ptah,
Hathor, and other deities, and have obliterated
the offending word “gods.”</p>

<p>The consternation which this action must have
caused was almost sufficient to bring about a
revolution in the provinces, where the old gods
were still dearly loved by the people. The
erasing of the name of Amon had been, after
all, a direct war upon a certain priesthood, and
did not very materially affect any other localities
than that of Thebes. But the suppression of the
numerous priesthoods of the many deities who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
held sway throughout Egypt threw into disorder
the whole country, and struck at the heart not
of one but of a hundred cities. Was the kindly
old artificer Ptah, with his hammer and his
chisel, to be tumbled into empty space? Was
the beautiful, the gracious Hathor&mdash;the Venus
of the Nile&mdash;to be thrown down from her celestial
seat? Was it possible to banish Khnum, the
goat-headed potter who lived in the caves of the
Cataract, from the life of the city of Elephantine;
the mysterious jackal Wepwat from the hearts
of the men of Abydos; or the ancient crocodile
Sebek from the ships and the fields of Ombos?
Every town had its local god, and every god
its priesthood; and surely the Pharaoh was
mad who attempted to make war upon these
legions of heaven. This Aton, whom the king
called upon them to worship, was so remote,
so infinitely above their heads. Aton did not sit
with them at their hearth-side to watch the
kettle boil; Aton did not play a sweet-toned
flute amongst the reeds of the river; Aton did
not bring a fairy gift to the new-born babe.
Where was the sacred tree in whose branches
one might hope to see him seated?&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>where
was the eddy of the Nile in which he
loved to bathe?&mdash;and where was the rock at
whose foot one might place, as a fond offering,
a bowl of milk? The people loved their old
gods, whose simple ways, kind hearts, and
quick tempers made them understandable to
mortal minds. But a god who reigned alone
in solitary isolation, who, more remote even
than the Jehovah of the Hebrews, rode not
upon the clouds nor moved upon the wings of
the wind, was hardly a deity to whom they
could open their hearts. True, the sunrise and
the sunset were the visible signs of the godhead;
but let the reader ask any modern Egyptian
peasant whether there is aught to stir the
pulses in these two great phenomena, and he
will realise that the glory of the skies could not
have appealed particularly to the lesser subjects
of Akhnaton, who, moreover, were not permitted
to bow the knee to the flaming orb itself. When
the Christian religion took hold of these peasants,
and presented for their acceptance the same
idea of a remote though loving and considerate
God, it was only by the elevation of saints and
devils, angels and powers of darkness, almost to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the rank of demigods, that the faith prospered.
But Akhnaton allowed no such tampering with
the primary doctrine, and St George and all
the saints would have suffered the erasure of
their very names.</p>


<h3>8. AKHNATON’S LAST DAYS AND DEATH.</h3>

<p>The troubles which Akhnaton by such actions
gathered around himself, while disturbing to his
adherents, must have given some degree of
pleasure to those nobles who saw in the king’s
downfall the only hope of Egypt. Horemheb,
the commander-in-chief of the inactive armies,
could now begin to prepare himself against the
time when he should lead a force into Syria
to restore Egyptian prestige. Tutankhaton,
betrothed to Akhnaton’s third daughter, could
dream of the days when he would make himself
Pharaoh, and carry the court back to glorious
Thebes. Even Meryra, the High Priest of
Aton, seems to have allowed his thoughts to
drift away from the City of the Horizon
wherein the sun of Egypt’s glory had set, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
it does not seem that he ever made use of the
tomb there prepared for him. These last stages
of Akhnaton’s life must thus have been embittered
by a doubt of the sincerity of his
closest friends, and by the knowledge that, in
spite of all their protestations, he had failed to
plant “the truth” in their hearts.</p>

<p>The queen had borne him no son to succeed to
the throne, and there appeared to be nobody
to whom he could impart what he felt to be
his last instructions. There can be no question
that he was still greatly loved by those who
surrounded his person, but there were few who
hoped that his religion, so disastrous to Egypt,
would survive him. In this extremity Akhnaton
turned to a certain noble, probably not of royal
blood, whose name seems to have been Smenkhkara,
though some have read it Saakara.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Nothing
is known regarding his previous career, but one
may suppose that he appeared to Akhnaton to
be the least unreliable of his followers. To him
the king imparted his instructions, revealing all
that words could draw from his teeming brain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
The little Princess Merytaton, now but twelve
years of age, was called from her games, and
with pomp and ceremony was married to this
Smenkhkara, thus making him the legitimate
heir to the throne, Merytaton being the eldest
daughter and sole heiress of the Pharaoh.</p>

<p>Feeling that his days were numbered, Akhnaton
then associated Smenkhkara upon the throne with
him as co-ruler, and was thus able to familiarise
the people with their future lord. In later
years, after Akhnaton’s death, Smenkhkara was
wont to write after his name the words “beloved
of Akhnaton,” as though to indicate that his
claim to the throne was due to Akhnaton’s
affection for him, as well as to the rights
derived from his wife.</p>

<p>But what mattered the securing of the succession
to the throne when that throne had
been shaken to its very foundations, and now
seemed to be upon the verge of utter wreck?
Akhnaton could no longer stave off the impending
crash, and from all sides there gathered the
forces which were to overwhelm him. His
government was chaotic. The plotting and
scheming of the priests of Amon showed signs
of coming to a successful issue. The anger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the priesthoods of the other gods of Egypt
hung over the palace like some menacing storm-cloud.
The soldiers, eager to march upon Syria
as in the days of the great Thothmes III.,
chafed at their enforced idleness, and watched
with increasing restlessness the wreck of the
empire.</p>

<p>Now through the streets of the city there
passed the weary messengers of Asia hurrying
to the palace, no longer bearing the appeals
of kings and generals for support, but announcing
the fall of the last cities of Syria and the
slaughter of the last left of their rulers. The
scattered remnants of the garrisons staggered back
to the Nile at the heels of these messengers,
pursued to the very frontiers of Egypt by the
triumphant Asiatics. From the north the Hittites
poured into Syria; from the south the
Khabiri swarmed over the land. As the curtain
is rung down on the turbulent scene, one
catches a glimpse of the wily Aziru, his hands
still stained with the blood of Ribaddi and of
many another loyal prince, snatching at this
city and trampling on that. At last he has
cast aside his mask, and with the tribute which
had been promised to Egypt he now, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
placates the ascending Hittites, whose suzerainty
alone he admits.</p>

<p>The tribute having ceased, the Egyptian treasury
soon stood empty, for the government of the
country was too confused to permit of the proper
gathering of the taxes, and the working of the
gold-mines could not be organised. Much had
been expended on the building of the City of
the Horizon, and now the king knew not where
to turn for money. In the space of a few years
Egypt had been reduced from a world power
to the position of a petty state, from the richest
country known to man to the humiliating condition
of a bankrupt kingdom.</p>

<p>Surely one may picture Akhnaton now in his
last hours, his jaw fallen, his sunken eyes widely
staring, as the full realisation of the utter failure
of all his hopes came to him. He had sacrificed
Syria to his principles; but the sacrifice was of
no avail, since his doctrines had not taken root
even in Egypt. He knew now that the religion
of the Aton would not outlive him, that the
knowledge of the love of God was not yet to
be made known to the world. Even at this
moment the psalms of the Aton were beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
upon his ears, the hymns to the God who had
forsaken him were drifting into his palace with
the scent of the flowers; and the birds which he
loved were singing as merrily in the luxuriant
gardens as ever they sang when they had inspired
a line in the king’s great poem. But
upon him now there had fallen the blackness of
despair, and already the darkness of coming
death was closing around him. The misery of
failure must have ground him down as beneath
the very mountains of the west themselves,
and the weight of the knowledge of all that
he had lost could not be borne by his enfeebled
frame.</p>

<p>History tells us only that, simultaneously with
the fall of his empire, Akhnaton died; and the
doctors who have examined his body report that
death may well have been due to some form
of stroke or fit. But in the imagination there
seems to ring across the years a cry of complete
despair, and one can picture the emaciated figure
of this “beautiful child of the Aton” fall forward
upon the painted palace-floor and lie still amidst
the red poppies and the dainty butterflies there
depicted.</p>

THE FALL OF THE RELIGION OF

<h3>1. THE BURIAL OF AKHNATON.</h3>


<p class="noindent">The body of Akhnaton was embalmed in the
city which he had founded; and while these
mortal parts of the great idealist were undergoing
the lengthy process of mummification, the
new Pharaoh Smenkhkara made a feeble attempt
to retain the spirit of his predecessor in the new
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>. Practically nothing is known of his
brief reign, but it is apparent from subsequent
events that he entirely failed to carry on the
work of Akhnaton, and the period of his
sovereignty is marked by a general tendency to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
abandon the religion of the Aton. Smenkhkara
had dated the first year of his reign from the
day of his accession as co-ruler with Akhnaton,
and thus it is that there are no inscriptions
found which record his first year, although there
are many references to his second year. The
main event must have occurred some three
months after the commencement of his sole
reign, when the body of Akhnaton was carried
in solemn state through the streets of the city
and across the desert to the tomb which had
been made for him in the distant cliffs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_258_fp.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>Death Mask of Akhnaton.</em></div>
</div>

<p>The mummy had been wrapped, as was usual,
in endless strips of linen; and amongst these
there was placed upon the royal breast a necklace
of gold, and over the face an ornament cut
in flat gold foil representing a vulture with wings
outstretched&mdash;a Pharaonic symbol of divine protection.
In many burials of this dynasty a
vulture such as this was placed upon the
mummy; and representations of an exactly
similar ornament are shown in the tombs of
Sennefer and others at Thebes. It is somewhat
surprising that the body of Akhnaton,
who was so averse to all old customs, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
thus have this royal talisman upon it; and it
would seem that some of the strict rules of
the Aton worshipper had already been relaxed
by his successor. Akhnaton had retained but
three of the ancient divine symbols, so far as
one can tell from the reliefs and paintings&mdash;namely,
the uræus or cobra, the sphinx, and
the hawk, which were often used as ornaments.
But one may ask whether the vulture had
really been dispensed with by him. It is true
that he banned the vulture-hieroglyph in the
inscriptions, as we have already seen on the
outer coffin of Queen Tiy;<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> but his reason for
so doing was that by such a hieroglyph the
name of the goddess Mut was called to mind,
and that goddess, being the consort of Amon,
was not to be tolerated. The vulture which
was laid upon the mummy, however, had nothing
to do with Mut, nor had it any likeness
to the hieroglyph. It was originally a representation
of the presiding genius of Upper
Egypt, and corresponded to the uræus, which
primarily represented the power of Lower Egypt.
It is true, again, that it was the custom for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Pharaohs to be shown in the sculptures and
paintings with this vulture hovering in protection
over their heads, and that Akhnaton seems
to have dispensed with such a symbol. But
this was perhaps due to the fact that the disk
and rays, symbolic of Aton, had taken its place
above the royal figure. There is no reason,
after all, to suppose that this form of vulture was
absolutely banned, since the uræus and the hawk
were retained;<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and though, as will presently be
seen, it will be natural to think that it was placed
on Akhnaton’s mummy at his successor’s suggestion,
there is nothing to show that Akhnaton
himself did not desire it to be laid there.</p>

<p>Over the linen bandages on the body there
were placed ribbons of gold foil encircling the
mummy&mdash;probably around the shoulders, the
middle, and the knees,&mdash;joined to other ribbons
running the length of the body at the back
and front. These ribbons were inscribed with
Akhnaton’s name and titles, and thus recorded
for all time the identity of the mummy to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
they adhered. Money being somehow found, the
body was wrapped in sheets of pure gold, sufficiently
thin to be flexible, and was placed in a
splendid coffin, designed in the usual form of a
recumbent figure, and inlaid in a dazzling manner
with rare stones and coloured glass. Down the
front of this coffin ran a simple inscription, the
hieroglyphs of which were also inlaid. It read:
“The beautiful prince, The Chosen One of Ra, the
King of Upper and Lower Egypt, living in Truth,
Lord of the Two Lands, Akhnaton, the beautiful
child of the living Aton, whose name shall live
for ever and ever.”<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> There is one curious feature
about this inscription. When Akhnaton made
the outer coffin for his mother, in or about the
twelfth year of his reign, he was particularly
careful not to use the hieroglyph representing
the goddess Maat when writing the word <em>maat</em>,
“truth.” But this sign is employed now upon
his own coffin; and one can only presume,
therefore, that the coffin was made after Akhnaton’s
death, and that the new Pharaoh Smenkhkara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
had not the same objection to the
representation of the goddess as had his
predecessor. We may now better understand
the presence of the vulture symbol also; for
it is obvious that before Akhnaton’s funeral had
taken place his strict <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> had been relaxed.</p>

<p>The royal mummy was now carried to its tomb
and there deposited, together with such funeral
furniture and offerings as were considered necessary.
The four alabaster canopic jars, always
conspicuous in an Egyptian burial, were here
not wanting. The stopper of each jar was
exquisitely carved to represent the head of
Akhnaton, wearing the usual male wig of the
period, and having the royal cobra upon the
forehead. From these heads one sees that the
art of Akhnaton was modified immediately after
his death, and its more pronounced characteristics
were already being toned down. This
slackening in the rules which Akhnaton had
made shows us how entirely dependent the
movement had been upon its leader; and we
realise the more clearly how strong a character
was his. Ere even the king’s burial had
taken place the death of his religion was assured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>


<h3>2. THE COURT RETURNS TO THEBES.</h3>

<p>Smenkhkara died, or was deposed, about a
year after Akhnaton’s death. He was succeeded
by another noble, Tutankhaton,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> who, in order
to legitimise his accession, obtained in marriage
Akhnaton’s second daughter Ankhsenpaaton, a
girl barely twelve years old. Thus Smenkhkara’s
wife, Merytaton, became a dowager-queen
at the age of thirteen or so, and her little sister
took her place upon the throne.</p>

<p>By this time the priests of Amon had begun
to hold up their heads once more, and to
scheme for the downfall of Aton with renewed
energy. Pressure was soon brought to bear
on Tutankhaton, and he had not been upon the
throne more than a year or so when he was
persuaded to consider the abandonment of the
City of the Horizon and his return to Thebes.
He did not yet turn entirely from the religion
of the Aton, but attempted to take a middle
course between the two factions, giving full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
licence both to the worshippers of the Aton
and to those of Amon. Horemheb, the commander-in-chief
of the idle army, seems to have
been one of the leaders of the reactionary movement.
He did not concern himself so much
with the religious aspect of the question: there
was as much to be said on the one side as on
the other. But it was he who knocked at
the doors of the heart of Egypt and urged
the nation to awake to the danger in Asia.
For him there were no scruples as to warfare,
and the doctrine of the sword found favour
in his sight. An expedition was fitted out,
and the reigning Pharaoh was persuaded to
lead it. Thus we read that Horemheb was
“the companion of his Lord upon the battlefield
on that day of the slaying of the Asiatics.”<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Akhnaton had dreamed of the universal peace
which still is a far-off wraith to mankind; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Horemheb was a practical man in whom that
dream would have been but weakness which
was such mighty strength in the dead king.</p>

<p>The new Pharaoh now changed his name
from Tutankhaton to Tutankhamon, and, to the
sound of martial music, returned to Thebes.
The City of the Horizon was left to its fate,
and it was not long before the palaces and
the villas became the home of the jackals and
the owls, while the temples were partly pulled
down to provide stone for other works. However
much the reigning Pharaoh differed in
views from Akhnaton, it would not have been
possible to leave the royal body lying in sight
of this wreck of all the hopes that had been
his. Akhnaton, moreover, was Tutankhamon’s
father-in-law, and it was only through the rights
of Akhnaton’s daughter that the Pharaoh held
the throne. His memory was still regarded
with reverence by many of his late followers,
and there could be no question of leaving his
body in the deserted city. It was therefore
carried to Thebes in its coffin, together with
the four canopic jars, and was placed, for want
of a proper sepulchre, in the tomb of Queen
Tiy, which had been reopened for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Tutankhamon showed the trend of his policy
by both restoring the temple of the Aton at
Karnak and at the same time repairing the
damage done by Akhnaton to the works of
Amon. The style of art which he favoured was
a modified form of Akhnaton’s method, and the
influence of his movement is still apparent in
the new king’s work. He did not reign long
enough, however, to display much originality,
and after a few years he disappears, almost
unnoticed, from the stage. On his death the
question of inviting Horemheb to fill the vacant
throne must have been seriously considered, but
there was another candidate in the field. This
was Akhnaton’s father-in-law, Ay, who had been
one of the most important nobles in the group
of courtiers at the City of the Horizon. It was
he who had sheltered Queen Nefertiti before she
had passed into Akhnaton’s palace, and it was
in his tomb that the great hymn to the Aton
was inscribed. He had been loudest in the
praises of the preacher king and of his doctrines,
and he still retained the title “Father-in-law”
as his most cherished designation.</p>

<p>Religious feeling at this time was running
high, for the partisans of Amon and those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Aton seem still to have been struggling for the
supremacy, and Ay appeared to have been regarded
as the most likely man to bridge the
gulf between the two factions. A favourite of
Akhnaton, and still tolerant of all that was
connected with the late movement, he was not
averse to the cult of Amon, and by conciliating
both parties he managed to obtain the throne
for himself. His power, however, did not last
for long, and as the priests of Amon regained
the confidence of the nation at the expense of
the worshippers of the Aton, so the prestige of
Ay declined. His past relationship to Akhnaton,
which even as king be carefully recorded within
his cartouche, now told against him rather than
for him, and about eight years after the death
of Akhnaton he disappeared like his predecessors.</p>


<h3>3. THE REIGN OF HOREMHEB.</h3>

<p>There was now no question who should succeed.
All eyes were turned to Horemheb, who had
already almost as much power as the Pharaoh.
The commander-in-chief at once ascended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
throne, and was received by the populace with
the utmost rejoicings. At this time there was
living at Thebes the Princess Nezemmut, the
sister of Akhnaton’s Queen Nefertiti, and hence
the daughter of Dushratta, King of Mitanni.
Owing to previous inter-marriages between the
royal house of Egypt and that of Mitanni, both
Nefertiti and Nezemmut were descendants of
Pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Nezemmut
had come to Egypt early in the reign of
Akhnaton, and later had perhaps married some
Egyptian nobleman; but she was now a widow,
and had recently been appointed to the post
of “Divine Consort,”&mdash;that is to say, High
Priestess&mdash;of Amon. As she was probably the
younger sister of Nefertiti, she may have been
about six years of age when Nefertiti was
married to Akhnaton at the age of eight.
Hence she would have been about twenty-three
at his death, and would now be just over
thirty.</p>

<p>To this princess, as representing both the rights
of the old line of Pharaohs and those of the god
Amon, without the now condemning close relationship
to Akhnaton which characterised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
other existing royal princesses, Horemheb was
at once married. The religion of the Aton was
now fast disappearing. In a tomb dating from
the third year of Horemheb’s reign, the words
“Ra whose body is Aton” occur; but this is the
last mention of the Aton, and henceforth Amon-Ra
is unquestionably supreme. A certain Pa-atonemheb,
who had been one of Akhnaton’s
favourites, was at about this time appointed
High Priest of Ra-Horakhti at Heliopolis, and
thus the last traces of the religion of the Aton
were merged into the Heliopolitan theology,
from which that religion at the beginning had
emanated.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_270_fp.jpg" width="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<em>The Temple at Luxor.</em></div>
</div>

<p>The neglected shrines of the old gods once
more echoed with the chants of the priests
throughout the whole land of Egypt. Inscriptions
tell us that Horemheb “restored the
temples from the pools of the Delta marshes to
Nubia. He fashioned a hundred images ...
with all splendid and costly stones. He established
for them daily offerings every day. All
the vessels of their temples were wrought of
silver and gold. He equipped them with priests
and with ritual priests, and with the choicest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the army. He transferred to them lands and
cattle, supplied with all necessary equipment.”
By these gifts to the neglected gods Horemheb
was striving to bring Egypt back to its natural
condition; and with a strong hand he was
guiding the country from chaos to order, from
fantastic Utopia to the solid old Egypt of the
past. He was, in fact, the preacher of sanity,
the very apostle of the Normal.</p>

<p>He led his armies into the Sudan, and returned
with a procession of captive chieftains roped before
him. He had none of Akhnaton’s qualms regarding
human suffering, and these unfortunate
prisoners are seen to have their arms bound in
the most cruel manner. Finding the country
to be lawless he drafted a number of stern laws,
and with sound justice administered his kingdom.
Knowing that Syria could not long remain quiet,
he organised the Egyptian troops, and so prepared
them that, but a few years after his death,
the soldiers of the reigning Pharaoh were swarming
once more over the lands which Akhnaton
had lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>


<h3>4. THE PERSECUTION OF AKHNATON’S MEMORY.</h3>

<p>The priests of Amon-Ra had now begun openly
to denounce Akhnaton as a villain and a heretic,
and as they restored the name of their god
where it had been erased, so they hammered
out the name and figure of Akhnaton wherever
they saw it. Presently they pulled down the
Aton temple at Karnak, and used the blocks
of stone in the building of a pylon for Amon-Ra.
Soon it was felt that Akhnaton’s body
could no longer lie in state, together with that
of Queen Tiy, in the Valley of the Tombs of
the Kings. The sepulchre was therefore opened
once more and the name “Akhnaton” was everywhere
erased from the inscriptions, as was his
figure from the scenes upon the shrine of Queen
Tiy. The mummy was lifted from its coffin and
the royal name was cut out of the gold ribbons
which passed round it, both at the back and
the front. It was then replaced in the coffin,
and from this the name was also erased.</p>

<p>The question may be asked why it was that
the body was not torn to pieces and scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
to the four winds, since the king was now so
fiercely hated. The Egyptians, however, entertained
a peculiar reverence for the bodies of
their dead, and it would have been a sacrilege
to destroy the mummy even of this heretic.
No thought could be entertained of breaking up
the body upon which the divine touch of kingship
had fallen: that would have been against
all the sentiments which we know the Egyptians
to have held. The cutting out of the name
of the mummy was sufficient punishment: for
thereby the soul of the king was debarred from
all the benefits of the earthly prayers of his
descendants, and became a nameless outcast,
wandering unrecognised and unpitied through
the vast underworld. It was the name “Akhnaton”
which was hated so fiercely; and one
may perhaps suppose that the priests would have
been willing to substitute the king’s earlier
name, Amonhotep, upon the mummy had they
been pressed to do so. His name and figure as
Amonhotep IV. is not damaged upon the monuments;
but only the representations of him
after the adoption of the name Akhnaton have
been attacked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>The tomb, polluted by the presence of the heretic,
was no longer fit for Tiy to rest in; and the body
of the queen was therefore carried elsewhere, perhaps
to the sepulchre of her husband Amonhotep
III. The shrine, or outer coffin, in which her
mummy had lain was pulled to pieces, and an
attempt was made to carry it out of the tomb
to its owner’s new resting-place, but this arduous
task was presently abandoned, and one portion
of the shrine was left in the passage, while the
rest remained in sections in the burial-chamber.
Some of the queen’s toilet utensils which had
been buried with her were also left, probably by
mistake. The body of Akhnaton, his name taken
from him, was now the sole occupant of the
tomb. The coffin in which it lay rested upon
a four-legged bier some two feet or so from the
ground, and in a niche in the wall above it stood
the four canopic jars. And thus, with a curse,
the priests left their great enemy. The entrance
of the tomb was blocked with stones, and
sealed with the seal of the necropolis; and all
traces of its mouth were hidden by rocks and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>.</p>

<p>The priests would not now permit the name of
Akhnaton to pass a man’s lips, and by the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of the reign of Horemheb, the unfortunate boy
was spoken of in official documents as “that
criminal.” Not forty years had passed since
Akhnaton’s death, yet the priesthood of Amon
was as powerful as it had ever been at any
period of its existence. There were still living
men who had been old enough at the time of
the Aton power to grasp its doctrines; and
those same eyes which had looked upon the fair
City of the Horizon might now disturb the
creatures of the desert in the ruined courts
where the grave boy-Pharaoh had presided so
lately. These men joined their voices to that
crowd of priests who, not daring to allow the word
Akhnaton to form itself upon their lips, poured
curses upon the excommunicated and nameless
“criminal.” Through starry space their execrations
passed, searching out the wretched ghost
of the boy, and banning him, as they supposed,
even in the dim uncertainties of the Lands
of Death. Over the hills of the west, up the
stairs of the moon, and down into the caverns
under the world, the poor twittering shadow
was hunted and chased by the relentless magic
of the men whom he had tried to reform. There
was no place for his memory upon earth, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the under-world the priests denied him a stone
upon which to lay his head. It is not easy now
to realise the full meaning to the Egyptians of
the excommunication of a soul: cut off from
the comforts of human prayers; hungry, forlorn,
and wholly desolate; forced at last to whine
upon the outskirts of villages, to snivel upon
the dung-heaps, to rake with shadowy fingers
amidst the refuse of mean streets for fragments
of decayed food with which to allay the pangs of
hunger caused by the absence of funeral-offerings.
To such a pitiful fate the priests of Amon
consigned “the first individual in history”; and
as an outcast amongst outcasts, a whimpering
shadow in a place of shadows, the men of Thebes
bade us leave the great idealist, doomed to the
horrors of a life which will not end, to the
misery of a death that brings no oblivion.</p>


<h3>5. THE FINDING OF THE BODY OF AKHNATON.</h3>

<p>Thus, sheathed in gold, the nameless body
lay, while the fortunes of Egypt rose and fell
and the centuries slid by. A greater teacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
than Akhnaton arose and preached that peace
which the Pharaoh had foreshadowed, and soon
all Egypt rang with the new gospel. Then
came the religion of Muhammed, and the days
of the sword returned. So the years passed,
and many a wise man lived his life and disappeared;
but the first of the wise men of
history lay undiscovered in the heart of the
Theban hills.</p>

<p>Now it happened that there was a fissure in
the rocks in which the sepulchre was cut, and
during the rains of each season a certain amount
of moisture managed to penetrate into the
chamber. This gradually rotted the legs of the
bier upon which Akhnaton’s body lay, and at last
there came a time when the two legs at the head
of the coffin gave way and precipitated the royal
body on to the ground. The bandages around
the mummy had already fallen almost to powder,
and this jerk sent the golden vulture which was
resting upon the king’s face on to his forehead,
where it lay with the tail and claws resting over
the left eye-socket of the skull. Presently the
two remaining legs of the bier collapsed, and
the whole coffin fell to the ground, the lid being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
partly jerked off, thus revealing the king’s head
at one end and his feet at the other, from all of
which the flesh had rotted away.</p>

<p>In January 1907 the excavations in the Valley
of the Tombs of the Kings which were being
conducted by Mr Theodore Davis, of Newport,
Rhode Island, U.S.A., on behalf of the Egyptian
Government, brought to light the doorway of
the tomb, and it was not long before an entrance
was effected. A rough stairway led down into
the hillside, bringing the excavators<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> to the
mouth of the passage, which was entirely blocked
by the wall which the priests had built after they
had entered the tomb to erase Akhnaton’s name.
Beyond this wall the passage was found to be
nearly choked with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of the three earlier
walls, the first of which had been built after
Queen Tiy had been buried here, the second
after Akhnaton’s agents had entered the tomb
to erase the name of Amon, and the third after
Akhnaton’s body had been laid beside that of his
mother. On top of this heap of stones lay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
side of the funeral shrine of the queen which the
priests had abandoned after attempting to carry
it out with her mummy. In the burial-chamber
beyond, the remaining portions of this shrine
were found. Upon these one saw the figures
of Akhnaton and his mother worshipping beneath
the rays of the Aton. The inscriptions showed
the erasure of the name of Amonhotep III., and
the substitution in red ink of that king’s second
name, Nebmaara; and one observed that at a
later date the name and figures of Akhnaton had
been hammered out.</p>

<p>At one side lay the coffin of Akhnaton, as it had
fallen from the bier. The name of Akhnaton
upon the coffin had been erased, but was still
readable; and the gold ribbons from which his
name had been cut out still encircled the body,
back and front. The golden vulture lay as has
been described above, and the necklace still
rested on the breast, while the whole decaying
body was found to be wrapped in sheets of gold.
In a recess above this coffin stood the canopic
jars, and in another part of the tomb Queen Tiy’s
toilet utensils were found, from one of which the
name of Amonhotep III. had been erased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The bones, when examined by Dr Elliot
Smith, F.R.S., were found to be those of a
young man of not more than about twenty-eight
years of age,&mdash;that is to say, the age at which
Akhnaton has been shown in the above pages
to have died. The skull was pronounced to be
that of a man who suffered from epileptic fits,
and who was probably subject to hallucinations.
Curiously enough, the idiosyncrasies of this misshapen
skull are precisely those which Lombroso
has stated to be so usual in a religious reformer.
The face had crumbled away, but the lower
jaw was intact; and when this was placed in
position one could see at once the great resemblance
to the well-known portraits of Akhnaton
which had survived the wreck of his city.</p>

<p>There could thus be no doubt that the
mummy of this wonderful Pharaoh had at last
been found; but since Akhnaton had always
been thought, though without particular reason,
to have been a much older man, the identity
was questioned. It was suggested that the body
was perhaps that of Smenkhkara, the successor
of Akhnaton, which by some error had managed
to be placed in Akhnaton’s coffin. But how,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
then, did the gold ribbons inscribed with
Akhnaton’s name manage to be placed around
the body? And apart from the extreme improbability
that the mummy which was thus
labelled with Akhnaton’s name, and which lay
in his coffin, should be that of any other king
but Akhnaton, one may ask in this case how
it is that the body has the well-known physical
characteristics of the great heretic if it be
that of Smenkhkara, who was not related to
the king?</p>

<p>It has been stated that the presence of the
vulture upon the body is against the identification
with Akhnaton. This has already been
shown to be capable of explanation; but it may
here be noted that if Smenkhkara would not
have placed the vulture upon Akhnaton’s body,
then by the same token the mummy is not
likely to be that of Smenkhkara, and there
is certainly no other prince of this period with
whom to identify the body. In conclusion, it
may be added that of all the royal mummies
now known there is not one which can be so
clearly shown to belong to the Pharaoh with
whom it has been identified as this mummy can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
be shown to belong to Akhnaton. The body
was lying in a coffin inscribed with Akhnaton’s
name; it was bound round with ribbons inscribed
with his name; it had the physical characteristics
of the portraits of Akhnaton; it had the idiosyncrasies
of a religious reformer such as he was;
it was that of a man of Akhnaton’s age as deduced
from the monuments; it lay in the tomb
of Akhnaton’s mother; those who had erased
the names must have thought it to be Akhnaton’s
body, unless one supposes an utter chaos of cross-purposes
in their actions; and finally, there is
nobody else who, with any degree of probability,
it could be.</p>

<p>Thus one may say that, without the vaguest
shadow of a doubt, the body of this the most
remarkable figure of early Oriental history has
been brought to light; and with this assurance
we may close this sketch of his life, which has
been written partly for the purpose of thus
explaining the significance of Mr Davis’s great
discovery, and partly to introduce the general
reader to one of the most interesting characters
ever known. In this brief outline it has only
been possible to touch upon the main characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
which the few remaining inscriptions
and monuments seem to reveal; but to the
most casual reader it will be apparent that
there stands before him a personality of surprising
vigour and amazing originality, and one
deserving of careful study. In an age of superstition,
and in a land where the grossest polytheism
reigned absolutely supreme, Akhnaton
evolved a monotheistic religion second only to
Christianity itself in purity of tone. He was
the first human being to understand rightly
the meaning of divinity. When the world
reverberated with the noise of war, he preached
the first known doctrine of peace; when the
glory of martial pomp swelled the hearts of
his subjects, he deliberately turned his back
upon heroics. He was the first man to preach
simplicity, honesty, frankness, and sincerity;
and he preached it from a throne. He was
the first Pharaoh to be a humanitarian; the
first man in whose heart there was no trace of
barbarism. He has given us an example three
thousand years ago which might be followed
at the present day: an example of what a
husband and a father should be, of what an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
honest man should do, of what a poet should
feel, of what a preacher should teach, of what
an artist should strive for, of what a scientist
should believe, of what a philosopher should
think. Like other great teachers he sacrificed
all to his principles, and thus his life plainly
shows&mdash;alas!&mdash;the impracticability of his doctrines;
yet there can be no question that his
ideals will hold good “till the swan turns black
and the crow turns white, till the hills rise up
to travel, and the deeps rush into the rivers.”</p>

this statement, however, may be that of Akhnaton (fig. 115, p.
182). The mouth and chin are extremely like those of Yuaa, as
seen in his mummy; but again they both have a close resemblance
to the head of Amonhotep III. (<em>idem</em>, fig. 120, p. 188). Of course,
such evidence is extremely frail, and must not be too much relied
upon.</p></div>

bear children at intervals of about two years, over a period of thirty
years or so. Fifteen children is thus the usual number of a family,

in the early years of Akhnaton’s reign, to have been left alone during
the remainder of the reign, and to have received the addition
of doorposts (see <a href="#Footnote_84">note on p. 265</a>) after the death of Akhnaton.
Fragments of the tomb are now divided between Leiden, Bologna,
Vienna, Alexandria, and Cairo; and it would seem that all except
those in the Cairo museum (the doorposts) are from the earlier
period. The titles on the Cairo fragments are far more elaborate
than those on the others. See Breasted, Records, iii. 1 ff.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> In the tomb of Huya the scene is dated in the twelfth year, as
here recorded, and there are four daughters shown, which is the
number one is led by other evidence to suppose were then alive.
The scene in the tomb of Meryra II. has precisely the same date,
but six daughters are shown, and there is evidence to show that that
number is not to be looked for previous to the fifteenth year of the
reign, the first daughter being born in about the fifth year, the
second in the seventh, the third in the ninth, the fourth in the
eleventh, the fifth in the thirteenth, and the sixth in the fifteenth
year, in all probability. Thus the scene in Meryra II. may perhaps
represent no particular reception of the tribute of any one year, but
the artist may have had in mind the great tribute of the twelfth
year while representing the occurrence in the fifteenth or sixteenth
year, at which date his work was taking place. Or again the date in
this latter tomb may be a misreading or miswriting. The scene described
above is that represented in the tomb of Meryra, as it is
more elaborate than the other; but the inscription is that found in
the tomb of Huya.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> It is probable, as has been stated on <a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>, that she was married
to Amonhotep III. in about her tenth year, and was thus about
forty-six when he died. She could not have been much more,
for her daughter Baketaton must have been born but a year or so
before Amonhotep’s death, and it is improbable that she would
bear children after forty-five, if as late as that.</p></div>
